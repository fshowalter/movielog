Self-proclaimed "Richard Lester enthusiast" Peter Tonguette's commentary is long on hero worship, short on insight. 

For example, Tonguette mentions Roy Kinnear's fatal accident. He notes the budget was slashed from sixteen to ten million dollars. But he never connects these dots. A tighter budget meant a more grueling schedule. A grueling schedule created dangerous conditions.

Worse, Tonguette rarely discusses what's actually happening on screen. Instead of describing the scene we're watching, he'll launch into a detailed breakdown of a sight gag in Lester's _Superman III_. The commentary becomes a random Lester filmography lecture, disconnected from the movie it's supposed to illuminate.

Thus, rather than explain why Oliver Reed is seated during most of his scenes, Tonguette meanders on about Lester's genius. 

Indeed, Tonguette says "Lester" roughly every fifteen seconds. I stopped counting after the first reel. By the end, you'll either worship the director or want to throw something at the screen.

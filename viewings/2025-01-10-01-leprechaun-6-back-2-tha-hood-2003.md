This 2014 commentary track pairs director Steven Ayromlooi with moderator James Oster for a candid discussion that reveals how studio mandates and production constraints shaped the final film.

Ayromlooi reveals his original pitch opened with the leprechaun sailing back to Ireland with his pot of gold, only to encounter a massive thunderstorm that shipwrecks him on a tropical island where he encounters a group of spring-breakers. He went so far as to produce a seventy-five page treatment before the producers abruptly decided they wanted to return to the prior film's "hood" setting.

This goes a long way toward explaining the script's pastiche nature as Ayromlooi admits he "didn't know anything about the fucking hood," and thus mimicked popular urban dramas.

This blunt honesty charms, and Ayromlooi maintains a self-deprecating tone as he admits to hating the page-wipe transitions and the oddly-placed clairvoyant vision.

Ayromlooi also reveals he'd storyboarded out the entire film, but multiple scenes and shots had to be altered or abandoned for time or money. For example, several scenes meant for night were shot during day to save money. Other scenes originally featured more gruesome deaths but were simplified when resetting the effects proved too time-consuming.

One suspects Ayromlooi would have benefited from a Roger Corman-style apprenticeship before tackling studio production. While he demonstrates admirable ability to improvise, more hands-on experience could have informed his writing and storyboarding, reducing the need for last-minute changes. He cites Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick as influences, envying their larger budgets while overlooking how both directors earned those budgets by first proving themselves on smaller films.

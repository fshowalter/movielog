Kat Ellinger and Samm Deighan bring genuine enthusiasm to their commentary track. They love this movie. They draw smart connections to Jess Franco's work. They contextualize Howard Vernon's mad scientist routine.

But they never answer the questions that matter.

Why cast a Bogart impersonator? Why repeat the murders in lurid colors? What's with the zombie head on Vernon's desk? They acknowledge these mysteries, but offer no answers.

Worse, they fall into the fan commentary trap: this film can do no wrong. Every bizarre choice is brilliant. Every rough edge is intentional. At one point, Deighan compares producer Dick Randall to Val Lewton.

Val Lewton. The man who made <span data-imdb-id="tt0034587">_Cat People_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0036027">_I Walked with a Zombie_</span>.

Dick Randall made _The French Sex Murders_.

It's a pleasant enough commentary, but skip it. Watch the 2005 _The Wild World of Dick Randall_ featurette instead. It runs thirty minutes and covers Randall's entire film career. Featuring interviews with Randall's collaborators and his widow, it offers actual insight into how these movies got made and why, and gave me a new appreciation for Randall's contributions to the genre.

Troy Howarth audio commentary. As always, his love for the material shines. He details the production, positions the film in Fulci’s broader career, and provides his usual comprehensive rundown of uncredited performers. He also gave me a new appreciation for the film’s technical merits. Required listening if you’re a Fulci fan coming from his horror films.

As always, Troy Howarth's love for the material shines in his audio commentary. He details the production, positions the film in Fulci’s broader career, and provides a comprehensive rundown of uncredited performers. His observations gave me a new appreciation for the film’s technical merits, such as Fulci's use of natural light and the split diopter lens. Required listening if you’re a Fulci fan coming from his horror films, as it provides all the context you need to appreciate the work.

USA cut. Inferior to the UK verison, it omits Bellaver's rock toss, and Lee's final line to Price.

Tim Lucas's commentary offers comprehensive insights delivered in a warm, conversational tone. Early on he points out how director Gordon Hessler, born in Germany but raised in England, brings a German cinematic influence to the picture, highlighted by an early mirror shot of a character shaving and the brassy jazz score that would be at home in an Edgar Wallace thriller. Lucas goes on to explain how the film was titled _Die lebenden Leichen des Dr. Mabuse_ in Germany, and--in an unexpected bit of trivia--that one of the film's biggest fans was director Fritz Lang himself, who brought the Mabuse character to the screen in three films.

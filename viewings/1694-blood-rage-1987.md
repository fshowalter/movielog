The _Nightmare at Shadow Woods_ version, which cut most of the film's gory practical effects to secure an R-rating, may prove interesting to fans of the film, if only because the producers had to splice in excised footage to fill out the running time.

The biggest addition comes via an opening scene set at the pool. While this introduces the pool setting earlier, thus bookending the finale, the scene is chock-full of redundant exposition and belongs on the cutting room floor.

The rest of the additions come via lengthening existing scenes. The original cut moved at a gangbusters pace, cutting scenes as tight as possible, sometimes cutting into dialogue midway, such as the scene with the complex manager offering his help to the institution doctor and her orderly. In this cut, it begins with the manager stepping up and introducing himself, before offering to help. In the original cut, the introduction is excised, and the cut goes to him mid-sentence, offering to help.

It's a subtle but important change. By cutting to dialogue in progress, the original version maintained a frantic pace, while the _Nightmare at Shadow Woods_ version moves in fits and starts. Even with the original pacing, this version would suffer, however, as it lacks the gory payoffs for the film's various setups. It's like watching a magic act with no tricks.

Daniel Kremer's commentary offers less a running analysis and more of a Sidney Furie appreciation audio essay.

We learn Furie came into the picture having been fired from <span data-imdb-id="tt0080948">_The Jazz Singer_</span>. Prior to that, Furie had quit <span data-imdb-id="tt0081230">_Night of the Juggler_</span>. Two strikes down, he needed this job, and the producers knew it. An early test came when Furie wanted to cast Craig T. Nelson as Barbara Hershey's boyfriend and the producers wanted Alex Rocco. Rocco got the part.

Kremer, author of _Sidney J. Furie: Life and Films_, is enthusiastic in his praise for the director, pointing out the myriad stylistic choices and non-traditional setups, including Dutch angles and intense close-ups. But Kremer also reveals the film's financing (involving tax deals) required the film shoot more than ten weeksâ€”double the usual length.

This diminishes Furie's achievement. Given twice the usual shooting schedule, he opted to tinker with technique instead of addressing the fundamental script problems. Kremer, too close to his subject, won't admit the ending doesn't work, though he acknowledges Furie "regretted" it.

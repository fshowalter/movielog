I don't think this was a studio-provided DCP. At least I hope not. The screen didn't adjust to the aspect ratio and the projection exhibited the judder inherent in a 60-to-24 fps pull-down, giving much of the film a "stop-motion animation" effect. A shame, as I'd long wanted to see this in theaters.

Director Kevin Tenney leads this 2014 audio commentary with cast members Cathy Podewell, Billy Gallo, Hal Havins, and special makeup effects creator Steve Johnson. It proves both entertaining and informative as the participants reflect fondly on their time making the film while cheerfully acknowledging its shortcomings.

Chief among said shortcomings was the script's plot holes, such as the house's ability to lock characters _in_ rooms, but not unlock rooms for the demons. Realizing there wasn't much he could do about this, Tenney dressed final girl Judy in an _Alice in Wonderland_ costume, seeking to subtly frame the script's inane logic as dream-like.

In keeping with this, Tenney shot all the scenes outside the haunted house with long lenses to compress the depth of field, while only using short lenses inside the house so it would seem deeper in comparison. This technique necessitated him setting up in the backyard to shoot the early bedroom scenes in Judy's house.

As an interesting bit of trivia, Tenney reveals the production's original title was "Halloween Party," but the producers, likely wary of <span data-imdb-id="tt0077651">_Halloween_</span> producer Moustapha Akkad's reaction, pushed for a change. Their suggestion of "Demon Boogie" sent Tenney scrambling for alternatives, one of which--_Night of the Demons_--thankfully prevailed.

Beyond behind-the-scenes information, the commentary offers an infectious enthusiasm that provides the perfect counterpoint to the film's acknowledged slow setup. As it unfolded, I found myself warming more to the film. The performers poke fun at the clunky dialogue, with Billy Gallo good-naturedly mocking his "Thank heaven for water pipes" line. During Podewell's nude scene, the group's mix of playful teasing and sincere praise reveals their lasting camaraderie, all tinged with endearing embarrassment.

Tenney also provides sound advice to aspiring filmmakers, saying, "Don’t write something you don’t have access to. Find what you have that has great production value and write your script around it." In this case, they found their house early in the production process, then rewrote the script to fit the house. Knowing the location early on also allowed Tenney extra time to scout and plan his shots, which pays off in the final product.

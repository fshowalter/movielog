Hawks's original cut, shown overseas to American servicemen but never released theatrically, is a good first draft, but there's a lot of fat. The scene of Bogart searching Geiger's apartment and the very talky plot recap in the DA's office after Bogart snares Lundgren, amount to dead air.

And the decision to dress Bacall in veil for one of her few scenes with Bogart is a head scratcher. Watch the theatrical cut instead.

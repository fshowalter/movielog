Samm Deighan's commentary works best as an introduction to Category III films for newcomers, providing solid context for where _Ebola Syndrome_ fits within Hong Kong's exploitation tradition. Established fans may find themselves wanting more specific production details and less general background. 

Still, her enthusiasm is infectious and I loved how she describes Category III cinema as "very wet films." Her frequent worry about offending listeners, however, undermines her otherwise confident analysis. After all, anyone listening to a commentary on _Ebola Syndrome_ has already made peace with Category III's transgressions.

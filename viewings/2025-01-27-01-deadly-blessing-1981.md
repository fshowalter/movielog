Wes Craven proves both entertaining and candid in this 2013 commentary moderated by David Gregory.

The film was shot in Texas during a cold snap. Craven calls it "freezing," which makes the actors' summer clothes and one character's apparent sweating during a jogging scene all the more impressive. 

Craven praises the local Texas crew's skill and adaptability, then drops a jarring anecdote: they cheered when news of John Lennon's assassination reached the set.

He cast local kids as the Hittite children, demonstrating his talent for casting to type. They look authentic without needing much dialogue or screen time. It's a reminder that Craven's eye for faces was always sharp, even when his material wasn't.

Gregory keeps the conversation moving when Craven falls silent, though something went wrong in post-production. During the barn sequence, the commentary drifts out of sync—an unusual mistake for Arrow Video. Craven discusses one spider while another crawls across the screen.

The bathtub scene yields a confession: Craven admits stealing it wholesale for <span data-imdb-id="tt0087800">_A Nightmare on Elm Street_</span>. He also borrowed the washcloth-over-face bit from <span data-imdb-id="tt0074860">_Marathon Man_</span>. Good artists borrow, great artists steal—and then recycle.

Having been raised fundamentalist Baptist, Craven brought personal experience to the script's religious elements. Though he only polished the original screenplay, his changes added authentic touches to the Hittite community.

Looking back, Craven views the film with clear eyes. He acknowledges the studio mandates that hampered his vision but owns his decisions without excuse-making. It's refreshing honesty from a director who could have easily blamed others.

The commentary ends on a charming note: Craven apologizes for the film's ridiculous coda. After all these years, he's still embarrassed by it.

In a 2015 commentary, moderator Ewan Cant prompts director John Grissmer for insight, but Grissmer responds to most early questions with one-word answers. As the film unfolds, he expands to single sentences. When asked how he achieved a memorable effect, he replies, “With a lot of work.” 

Grissmer regards the picture as a work-for-hire effort, scuttling my hopes he was drawn to the material's doppelgänger plot given its similarity to his earlier picture, <span data-imdb-id="tt0074510">_Scalpel (1977)_</span>.

John Dalley, who now co-owns the picture, offers little insight, but speaks with enthusiasm that goes beyond mere salesmanship.

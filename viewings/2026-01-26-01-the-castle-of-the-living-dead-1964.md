Troy Howarth and Nathaniel Thompson deliver their usual engaging, conversational commentary, highlighting strengths while acknowledging flaws. They open discussing the movie's various titles and its relative obscurity until this release. Howarth provides his trademark overview of the cast and crew's connections to other genre work, and both offer educated guesses on the uncredited English-language voice actors.

Howarth does a strong job placing _Castle_ within Lee's filmography, and the commentary concludes by squashing long-standing rumors: Warren Kiefer was indeed the director, and Michael Reeves' contributions extended only to some second unit work.

Chalk this up as another instance where listening to Howarth talk about a film proves more engaging than the film itself.

This 2018 career-spanning interview with writer-director James Bond III is presented as an audio commentary. Technical issues hamper the presentation--while interviewer Joe Rubin's questions come through clearly, Bond III's answers sound distorted, as though coming through a speakerphone cranked for volume.

Bond III reveals how much of the cast and crew came from Spike Lee's <span data-imdb-id="tt0096054">_School Daze_</span>, where he had performed, but his casual remark about casting the rest by "getting out my phone book" because "people wanted to be a part of cinematic history" proves revealing.

This lack of introspection pervades the interview. Bond III offers nothing about potential changes in hindsight or production challenges. He declines to cite specific influences--most notably _Ganja and Hess_--and doesn't mention Ernest Dickerson's substantial directorial contributions.

Yet his earnest, self-assured responses echo his character's personality so closely, one wonders how much of Joel's self-righteousness came from Bond III himself.

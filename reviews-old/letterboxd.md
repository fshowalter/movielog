The Locket

Trite story based on psychobabble with execution so convoluted and over-the-top, it borders on parody. Example: Mitchum’s flashback-within-a-flashback voice-over narration saying “I sent her a telegram.” Day enters the room. “I got your telegram,” she says.

His Kind of Woman

Gambler Mitchum finds himself coerced into visiting a Mexican resort so deported gangster Burr can steal Mitchum's identity and re-enter the states. Odd mix of film noir, melodrama, and Hollywood satire works thanks to the strong performances and crackling dialog.

My favorite line goes to Price, who locks Russel in a closet and announces to his estranged wife:

If I'm not here by Wednesday, chop that door down!

The Bribe

Noir-tinged procedural sees G-Man Taylor travel to a Central American fishing resort to ferret out a graft racket. The first 80 minutes are passable—buoyed by Gardner's charisma and Laughton's turn as a smarmy leech—but it's the fireworks-laden finale that registers.

Young and Innocent

Constable’s daughter Pilbeam aids fall guy fugitive De Marney in finding the real culprit behind an actress’s murder. Early British thriller from Hitchcock starts strong, drags in the middle, then recovers with an impressive finale.

The Prisoner of Shark Island

Uneven account of Samuel Mudd’s imprisonment on Dry Tortugas island for treating John Wilkes Booth after Lincoln’s assassination. Baxter’s charismatic performance drowns in overwrought melodrama.

Apartment for Peggy

Pregnant Crain and her GI-Bill husband Holden move into aging professor Gwenn's attic, leading Gwenn to rediscover his self-worth. Gwenn’s practiced charm and a darker than expected script overcome Crain’s cloying performance.

Beat the Devil

Huston and Capote’s tongue-in-cheek tale follows a cadre of desperate scoundrels en route to central Africa where they hope to execute a scam involving Uranium rights. Disappoints on first pass but improves with every viewing. The trick is to ignore the overall story and focus on each scene as a stand-alone piece, relishing the Capote’s dialog and Bogie’s bemused reactions.

Super Troopers 2

A group of former Vermont state troopers finds themselves back in uniform patrolling a small Canadian town set to become part of the United States. Self-aware sequel sees Canadian mounties subbing for the first film's local police department. Plenty of laughs for fans of the original, just not as memorable.

Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid

Coburn plays Garrett, a gunslinger turned sheriff charged with ousting the Kid, his one-time friend, played by Kristofferson. After deconstructing western archetypes in Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), Peckinpah tries his hand at a real-life western legend. Coburn's solid as always and Kristofferson proves a charismatic revelation but they can't overcome the loss of cinematographer Lucien Ballard and a muddled script incapable of transcending its historical roots.

Land of the Pharaohs

Hawkins plays an Egyptian Pharaoh obsessed with gold and treasure, Collins plays the scheming mistress who—ah, who cares? Everything about this film, from the ludicrous casting to the flat characters screams, “What was Hawks thinking?” Lone redeeming quality: its box office failure caused Hawks to step back, regroup, and come back four years later with Rio Bravo (1959).

Somewhere in Sonora

Fifth of a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros. in 1932. A remake of Ken Maynard's silent Somewhere in Sonora (1927) that recycles footage from the original. Cowboy Wayne joins an outlaw gang to break up a mine robbery and rescue a friend's estranged son. Wayne offers hints of the star he'd become, but the dialog proves laughable when delivered by the wooden supporting cast. The barroom brawl scene serves as the lone standout.

Baby Face

"Use men to get the things you want!"

The first half plays like vintage exploitation with Stanwyck flashing her calves and sleeping her way up the corporate ladder, including a brief fling with a young, eye-shadow laden John Wayne. Then Brent makes his entrance and the film loses its edge, devolving into a predictable—albeit passable—melodrama.

The Swimmer

Lancaster descends into hell via a series of backyard pools. Intriguing, disturbing, and brilliant.

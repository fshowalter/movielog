_WolfCop_ is about an alcoholic sheriff’s deputy who becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town. It’s ridiculous in the best possible way.

They don’t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays, B movies are homogenized, euphemistic, schlock neutered for release on basic cable. The manic energy is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can’t disguise their contempt for the material.

To that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seem to be enjoying themselves. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.

Consider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. The change begins as he relieves himself. Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon.

It’s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character’s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.

Not every scene is as calculated. Scenes like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that’s okay. The film’s only pushing the werewolf genre tropes to their natural extremes.

In _WolfCop_, it’s not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It’s “What if a drunken cop stereotype became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes.

But let’s face it, the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn’t it?

British spy Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) uncovers a Texas tycoon's plot to incite a coup in Communist country.

_Billion Dollar Brain_ is the third in a series of films chronicling the exploits of British spy Harry Palmer, and you'd best have seen one of the earlier ones because there's nothing in the way of introduction or characterization for Michael Caine's character this time around.

Instead, he's quickly tossed into a convoluted plot involving double agents, a super computer, and a Texas tycoon. You might find the plot a bit hard to follow, but that's only because you've likely fallen through one of the many gaping holes. A spy movie has to be intriguing, but John McGrath's screenplay borders on incomprehensible.

For his part, director Ken Russell does the only thing he can and keeps his foot firmly on the gas, steamrolling through the various set pieces as the film builds to its increasingly over-the-top conclusion featuring Ed Begley's comical spoof of Texas right-wing conservative billionaires.

Thankfully, Caine's innate presence and charisma keep the whole mess watchable, though only just. It's a shame as the Harry Palmer character, as played by Caine, served as a refreshing change from the gadget heavy James Bond, and provided a more realistic view of espionage activities. At least until this fiasco.

The dead are returning to life in murderous rages. You drive up to an remote country house expecting to find the police, but all is dark. You get out of the car and call out, attracting the attention of your brother-in-law's reanimated corpse who attacks with ferocity. You manage to get back in the car and escape. A few hundred feet down the road you pull over and get out of the car again, for no apparent reason. This bit of inanity proves the lone blemish on what's otherwise a terrific zombie picture.

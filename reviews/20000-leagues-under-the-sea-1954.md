In the late 19th century, a scientist (Paul Lukas), his assistant (Peter Lorre) and a sailor (Kirk Douglas) find themselves prisoners aboard a futuristic submarine helmed by the enigmatic Captain Nemo (James Mason).

_20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ is a mixed bag. James Mason and Paul Lukas are great in well-developed roles, but Kirk Douglas and Peter Lorre are little more than plot devices. Unfortunately for the movie, Douglas was the biggest draw at the time and gets a lot of screen time despite not having much to do.

The special effects are great, even by today’s standards, although the movie is prone to dwelling on some of the underwater shots which, while they may have been eye popping in 1954, don’t’ pack the same punch today.

_20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ is best when it focuses on the interactions between Mason and Lukas. Despite being a Disney film, the character of Nemo remains a sympathetic antagonist and its left to the viewer to decide who, if anyone, is the true villain.

A show-off (Burt Reynolds) and his buddy try to ferry four hundred cases of Coors beer from Texas to Georgia, while being pursued by a sheriff (Jackie Gleason).

_Smokey and the Bandit_, while not a great movie, is an entertaining one. Director Hal Needham crafts an easy, fun ride that is carried along by the great performances of the stars, Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason.

Reynolds shines in the role he would basically repeat through most of the '80s. His bandit is almost impossible to dislike, a bubbling brew of testosterone and charm, while Gleason eats up the scenery as the memorable Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

The car chases and stunts are all handled well, and the songs by Jerry Reed are annoyingly catchy, but itâ€™s all secondary to the great performances from the leads.

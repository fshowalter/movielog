_Crank: High Voltage_ is a wonderful satire of modern action films.

The story sees Jason Statham reprise his role as a professional assassin who, after Chinese mobsters steal his heart (literally), finds himself in need of regular jolts of electricity in order to keep his battery-powered replacement working.

The opening frames, showcasing an 8-bit shoot’em up video game, foreshadow the film to come, and the following scene, featuring John de Lancie as a TV news anchor, sets the film’s near-perfect tone.

And that’s a big part of what makes _Crank: High Voltage_ so good. It walks the fine line between over-the-top satire and smug, self-referential pomp, but never falters, and never, for a moment, takes itself too seriously.

Nor is it a throwaway, low-budget paycheck. This is a movie that looks like it was worlds of fun to make for everyone involved, and their love and enjoyment show through on the screen. Everyone looks like they’re having a good time but, at the same time, everyone seems to care about the final product.

That said, _Crank: High Voltage_ isn’t for everyone. The film’s satirical slant will likely be lost on those with a general distaste for action films, as well as those with an undying love for the genre. Fortunately, the majority of viewers fall somewhere in the middle, and thus should enjoy the film’s over-the-top antics and wink-to-the-audience vibe.

Two couples ignore multiple warnings and visit Castle Dracula.

_Dracula: Prince of Darkness_ is Hammer Film's third Dracula picture, although the second- <span data-imdb-id="tt0053677">_Brides of Dracula_</span>--didn't actually feature Dracula (or Christopher Lee) at all. This time around Christopher Lee is back as Dracula, but Peter Cushing is absent as Van Helsing and, as much as Lee's presence was missed in _Brides_, Cushing's is missed here.

Director Terrance Fisher does his usual fine job. His excellent use of color is particularly evident here, with ample amounts of bright red blood contrasting with black shadows, a scheme mirrored in Dracula's cloak.

The script moves along at a reasonable pace, but doesn't give enough screen time to Christopher Lee. Without the presence of Peter Cushing, the film drags whenever Lee isn't on the screen. Andrew Keir makes a valiant attempt at filling Cushing's shoes but simply lacks Cushing's presence.

Though reasonably entertaining and wonderful to look at, this proves ultimately a letdown compared to Lee's previous Dracula film.

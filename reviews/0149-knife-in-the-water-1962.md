A married couple pickup a college-age hitchhiker and invite him abound their sailboat for an overnight outing in Poland’s Lake District. Nothing happens yet enverything happens.

I kept wondering how Polanski shot it. That’s a real boat on a real lake. Not much room for cameras or lights, yet Polanski places us onboard as a forth passenger.

Then there’s the subtext. The husband is nearing middle age and goes out of his way to assert dominance over the young man. The wife, about the same age as the young man, carries a mature confidence aboard ship the belies her years. As the voyage unfolds, she morphs from prim librarian to sultry sexpot. The young man chafes against control, yet seems drawn to it. The script places these volotile elements into a closed space than allows the results to unfold organically. I kept waiting for a traditional plot twist, and when none proved forthcoming, felt ever more uncomfortable.

Which brings us to the ending. This one stuck to my ribs. After placing us aboard the boat, Polanski ends us by placing us inside the couple, inviting--nee forcing--us to confront how we would react in their shoes. A cinematic dictionary would define haunting with the film's closing shot of the couple's car at the crossroads. It's not a knockout, but a solid blow across the jaw that left me reeling.

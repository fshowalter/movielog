And so it comes to this. The improbable ten-year, six-film franchise ends with its worst entry.

It opens with an animated introduction proffering an origin story for the leprechaun. This idea sprung from director Steven Ayromlooi, who had a background in animation.[^1] This foreshadows his inherent misunderstanding of the series. The franchise’s only through-line was Warwick Davis as the titular creature. One doesn’t watch a _Leprechaun_ film for continuity.

Recycling <span data-imdb-id="tt0209095">the prior film</span>’s setting, we’re once again in south-central Los Angeles. A local group of young adults discovers the Leprechaun’s treasure chest, leading to his resurrection as he seeks to reclaim it.

Fair enough, but it takes an interminable near thirty minutes to get the leprechaun up and killing. Instead, endure an urban drama pastiche involving rival drug dealers and a girl who dreams of escaping the hood and going to college. The performers deliver their lines with the over-emoted gravitas of a prime-time medical drama. It could be laughable--instead, it’s just tedious. More would-be comedy from a stoner side-kick also feels recycled.

Compounding matters, once Davis begins his murder spree, the kills disappoint. Once again, Ayromlooi demonstrates a misunderstanding of the franchise, as the cartoonish, over-the-top deaths that highlighted prior entries are out in favor of simple stabbings. At least they’re graphic. At one point, the leprechaun loses an eye in a mess of green blood and gore.

But most of the film sees the leprechaun as a generic monster. Reminiscent of <span data-imdb-id="tt0116861">Part Four</span>, which also grafted the leprechaun onto an unrelated story, the notion of perverse wishes is gone. But unlike Part Four, this entry fumbles its attempts at humor.

One scene sees the stoned leprechaun attempt to find a snack and wind up trapped in the refrigerator. Another sequence sees Davis try to woo a girl over the phone by hinting at his physical endowment. These bits fall flat because they play too broad. Any small person could get trapped in a refrigerator or brag on their anatomy.

The franchise’s best humor comes from the leprechaun’s outrageous behavior, as illustrated by the film’s lone successful gag. Davis steals a police car, only to discover he can’t reach the pedals. His matter-of-fact solution involving a severed limb made me chuckle aloud.

For his part, Davis seems to sense the impending end. He looks tired in most of his scenes. Some blame falls on the grueling three-week shooting schedule,[^2] but I suspect disappointment with the material factored in as well. Regardless, I don’t blame him. He, and the franchise, deserved better.

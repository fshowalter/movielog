A soldier (Robert Mitchum) helps a detective (Robert Young) investigate a murder that points to a soldier (Robert Ryan).

_Crossfire_ is a taunt film-noir from director Edward Dmytryk featuring a breakout performance from Robert Ryan.

Much as he did in his earlier film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0037101">_Murder, My Sweet_</span>, Dmytryk does a great job using light and shadow to create atmosphere. The story is essentially just a pulp detective story with a twist, but Dmytryk's direction and Ryan's chilling performance elevate it something more.

Ryan steals the film with a knockout turn as an anti-Semitic soldier. It's a role that could easily be overplayed, but Ryan's cool menace is both frightening and believable. It also earned Ryan an Oscar nomination, though he lost to Edmund Gwenn in <span data-imdb-id="tt0039628">_Miracle on 34th Street_</span>.

For his part, Robert Mitchum brings his usual easy charm and helps bridge the gaps between Ryan's powerful appearances. To his credit, Mitchum doesn't try to steal the film and despite his second billing, handles what's essentially a supporting role with grace.

The film's only real mistake was changing the story's focus from homophobia to the less-taboo anti-Semitism. While this may have helped the film in 1947, it still feels like something of a cop-out that only serves to date the film, whereas a homophobia motive could easily serve as the basis of a film made today.

Despite this misstep, _Crossfire_ is definitely worth a look. At only 86 minutes, Dmytryk turns in a very lean film packed with great performances that moves quickly and looks fantastic.

In 1855 England, two criminals (Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland) set out to commit the first successful robbery of a moving train.

_The First Great Train Robbery_ is a descent heist film that should have been great.

Sean Connery is, as always, good in the lead. He handles the script's dramatic, comedic, and action elements with ease, and is fun to watch. Donald Sutherland, however, lacks Connery’s charm and is somewhat ill fitting as a Victorian rogue. That’s not to say Sutherland is bad, but rather that after seeing Connery and Michael Caine’s chemistry in <span data-imdb-id="tt0073341">_The Man Who Would Be King_</span> you’re bound to think this picture would have been a perfect re-teaming.

Indeed, the casting of Caine and a reunion with director John Huston could have made all the difference in the world. While writer/director Michael Crichton does a very competent job, there’s a certain sense of atmosphere that’s missing. This has everything to do with the little things. While Crichton makes sure the costumes and sets are all suitable to the period, they don’t _seem_ authentic. The clothes aren’t dirty and the sets aren’t messy. _The First Great Train Robbery_ feels well produced, but not lived in.

After the death of his partner, an FBI agent (Jason Statham) tracks an elusive assassin (Jet Li).

War is an impressive picture. Unfortunately, it’s for all the wrong reasons. Somehow the filmmakers managed to make action picture staring Jason Statham _and_ Jet Li that’s, well... boring.

Statham and Li are about the only positives in this mess. The script is littered with trite dialog and doesn’t have a whole lot of action, the director (fresh out of MTV) seems to believe that rapid edits can substitute for style, and the production has a distinctly staged feel right from the opening sequence.

The debacle that this picture became is a real shame because Statham and Li deserve better. The same premise given to a better screenwriter and director (John Woo would have been _perfect_) could have produced something really special.

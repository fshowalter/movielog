The story behind the famous "Miracle on Ice" victory by the United States over the Soviet Union during the 1980 Olympics.

If _Miracle_ weren't based on a true story, the plot would be much too trite and predictable, but the fact that _is_ based on a true story gives the cliched plot weight and allows the movie to shine.

Like any good movie based on popular events, _Miracle_ focuses less on the event itself (in this case the 1980 Olympic Hockey semi-final between the United States and the Soviet Union) and more on the back-story leading up to it. The filmmakers decided to eschew the ensemble approach many team-sport films take in favor of focusing on the coach, played by Kurt Russel. This was a great move, as Russell delivers a fantastic performance.

With a running time of 135 minutes _Miracle_ isn't short, but it never feels long either. While a few minutes could have been shaved here or there, the movie is pretty tight and doesn't drag. This is important because the movie spans several months and walks the fine line between full-story and epic.

If I had to split hairs, I could say the players themselves were somewhat under-characterized. A weak sub-plot involving the goalie and his father is never fully realized and some of the players are never more than faces. Still, this was a conscious decision, and one I don't think the filmmakers regret.

Perhaps the best praise I can offer is that I'm not a hockey fan but I enjoyed this movie.

A former GI (Humphrey Bogart) tries to rebuild his life in postwar Tokyo.

_Tokyo Joe_ is a fairly sub-par Humphrey Bogart vehicle, notable only for its subject matter (postwar Japan) which, at the time, had not been addressed by Hollywood.

Bogart is solid, but the script backing him up has a laborious second act that drags the whole movie down. The screenwriters were likely trying to recreate the successful mix of action and romance that had brought Bogart such success with <span data-imdb-id="tt0034583">_Casablanca_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0040506">_Key Largo_</span>, but Florence Marly is hardly in the same league as Ingrid Bergman or Lauren Bacall.

Director Stuart Heisler does the best with what he has, and delivers a particularly memorable closing shot, but again, the script ultimately proves his undoing.

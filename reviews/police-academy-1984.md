A slacker (Steve Guttenberg) leads a group of misfit recruits against a tyrannical instructor (G.W. Bailey) at a metropolitan police academy.

_Police Academy_ sure seemed a lot funnier 20 years ago. That's not to say it's bad per-se (it's entertaining in a nostalgic sort of way), but it's certainly not the riot I remember. Or maybe it is.

See, _Police Academy_ is one of those movies you remember being a lot funnier than it actually is. Michael Winslow's voice effects were novel at the time and so you remember them as being funny; but 20 years later they're no longer novel and not all that funny. Such is the case with most of the movie.

Further, unlike <span data-imdb-id="tt0087332">_Ghostbusters_</span> which also turns twenty this year, _Police Academy_ dates itself at almost every turn. From the fashions to the haircuts, _Police Academy_ is firmly rooted in 1984. Granted, this is not a bad thing per-se, but it doesn't help.

Also slightly unnerving is the gratuitous amount of Guttenberg's shirtless chest and arms we're shown. I never picked up on this twenty years ago, but it's clear the filmmakers were setting Guttenberg up as a sexy leading-man type; which obviously never panned out. This is a good thing.

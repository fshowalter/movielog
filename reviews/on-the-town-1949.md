Three sailors (Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin) have 24 hours to meet girls and see the sights of New York City.

_On the Town_ is, in many ways, the movie <span data-imdb-id="tt0037514">_Anchors Aweigh_</a> should have been. Instead of getting bogged down in a tired plot with a whiny kid, stars Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra more or less roam free, chasing girls and having a ball. It's a fun, airy film strung together by more than a few memorable song and dance numbers.

Betty Garrett, Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen all work well as the sailors' love interests, with Vera-Ellen the weakest of the three and Betty Garrett the best, turning in a fine comedy performance in addition to her singing and dancing. All the girls bring a good amount of charm and match the film's easygoing tone.

Aside from MGM's ever-present typecasting of Sinatra as a na√Øve boy next door type that handicaps his natural charm, _On the Town_ doesn't have many faults. The performance-within-a-movie where Kelly, Vera-Ellen and a cadre of dancers retell the film's entire story through dance feels indulgent, but it's a minor stumble.

Granted, as a song-and-dance musical comedy, the genre itself doesn't allow for much depth, and while you may remember a routine or two, the film's story really doesn't stick with you. But is it meant to? Before summer blockbusters, this was the popcorn staple; a breezy 98 minutes to sit back and enjoy, no thought required. While, sadly, this was Kelly and Sinatra's final team up, they certainly went out on a high note.

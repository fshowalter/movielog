_San Quentin_ is a fairly routine melodrama, elevated by a quality cast.

The plot sees ex-Army officer Pat O'Brien join San Quentin's prison guards and fall for the sister (Ann Sheridan) of one of the inmates (Humphrey Bogart).

O’Brien, Bogart, and Sheridan all radiate charisma, with O’Brien in particular feeling custom tailored to the part of the stern, but well-meaning prison guard. Even the supporting cast is above par, with Barton MacLane and Joe Sawyer giving fine turns as a corrupt guard and hardened criminal, respectively.

Director Lloyd Bacon keeps the running time down to a lean 70 minutes, moving through a lot of plot in an efficient manner while still allowing his stars to shine. This is a popcorn movie, to be sure, but one that doesn’t wear out its welcome.

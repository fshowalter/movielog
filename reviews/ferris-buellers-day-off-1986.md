_Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_ is a modern fairy tale.

The plot concerns a high school senior played by Matthew Broderick, who skips school to enjoy a day in the city with his friends, outwitting his parents and school principal in the process.

But, despite the title, the movie isn’t really about Ferris. Instead, it’s about his friend Cameron who, through Ferris, finds the strength to stand up to his domineering father.

Ferris isn’t a real person. He’s the person we all _think_ exists but, as writer/director John Hughes’ earlier film, The Breakfast Club (1985) showed, actually doesn’t. He exists in the film as a kind of mischievous fairy godmother, helping those around him realize their dreams, and having fun along the way.

Despite the somewhat dated fashions, the movie ages well. Hughes’s well-written dialog goes a long way toward his end, as do the performances of the Broderick and Jeffrey Jones as his principal nemesis.

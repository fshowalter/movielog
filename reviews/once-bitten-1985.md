Lauren Hutton is a 400-year-old vampire that needs to drink the blood of a virgin in order to maintain her youth. She's having a tough time finding one in 1985 Los Angeles until she meets a sexually frustrated Jim Carrey.

First the good:

1. Lauren Hutton is enjoyable as a vamp, and has the funniest scene in the movie.
2. There's another funny scene in the movie.
3. There's a pretty good dance number.

That's about it for the good.

Now the bad:

1. The supporting cast is weak.
2. The script is weak.
3. The sets are weak.
4. Most of the jokes are weak.

Sense a theme with the bad? This movie could have been really good, Jim Carrey and Lauren Hutton have screen presence and with a better script this could have been a great dark comedy, as opposed to the flat sex-comedy it is.

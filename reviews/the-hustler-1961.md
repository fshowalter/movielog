“Fast” Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) hustles his way to the top of the pool world.

_The Hustler_ is an atmospheric, powerful drama highlighted by a knockout performance by Paul Newman.

The film drips atmosphere, from the seedy pool halls to the dingy bus station, The Hustler feels authentic, all the while permeating an aura of grim destiny. This is a story of one man’s march to the top, so blind by the journey that he can’t see there’s nothing waiting for him once he gets there.

Newman is fantastic in the lead, conveying the perfect blend of toughness, arrogance, and naivety to bring “Fast” Eddie Felson to life. From his deft touch with the pool cue to his famous “I don’t rattle, kid!” Newman delivers a performance second only to his fantastic turn in <span data-imdb-id="tt0057163">_Hud_</span>.

Opposite Newman, Piper Laurie is good as his would-be love interest. While she does overplay a few of her bigger scenes (the film’s only misstep), she still manages to uphold the sense of gritty realism director Robert Rossen aims for.

Supporting Newman and Laurie are two fine performances by Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott. Gleason makes a strong impression despite a relatively small role, and Scott gives an award worthy turn as the devil Felson deals with to realize his ambitions.

The Hustler is so damn close to perfect, with an absolutely spot-on ending, that it’s tempting to give it the ‘A’, but Laurie’s over-the-top moments don’t age well and hurt what would otherwise be a perfect film.

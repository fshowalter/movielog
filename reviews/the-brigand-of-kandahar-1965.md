The Brigand of Kandahar is a wildly uneven, and ultimately disappointing adventure film from Hammer Film Productions.

Set in 1850, on the North West Frontier of India, the story sees Ronald Lewis play Lieutenant Case, a British Indian Army officer. Upon returning from a reconissance mission, he's jailed on trumped-up, racially-motivated charges. He escapes and joins a brigand group led by Eli Khan, played by Oliver Reed.

Like all of the performers playing middle-eastern characters, Lewis and Reed sport brown-face makeup. While unfortunate, Hammer worked with a stock company of actors and thus made do with what they had. Further, there are no derogatory stereotypes or accents.

That aside, Lewis underwhelms. He does a respectable job, but the role harkens back to the Errol Flynn adventure of the 30s, and Lewis lacks Flynn's innate charisma and energy.

Reed fares better. While equally miscast, he seems aware of it, and eschews any semblence of cultural realism, and instead plays an over-the-top warlord, sporting his usual twinkle of mischif in his smile and eyes. He's under-utilized, disappearing for large segments before an early exit. Disappointing as he's the film's biggest asset.

The second-largest asset comes via its large-scale battle scenes, notably an ambush that sees the British forces led into a basin where scores of extras reveal themselves on the surrounding hills and open fire as scores more calvary thunder down the hillside on horseback.

But these scenes seem shot on a different film stock, which is noticable when cutting between the battle and the principals, who don't even seem to be outdoors, surrounded by paper-mache boulders in front of a matte backdrope. Compounding matters, the film tries to insert the principals into the battle via awkward rear projection, making an already cheap production look even cheaper.

A better script might have made it easier to overlook such things. But director John Gilling's offering proves tepid, featuing predictable plot points, and a muddled ending which tries to be both pro and anti-war. He mistakes plot for drama, offering a film in which a lot happens, but nothing grabs us. Worst of all, he wastes Oliver Reed.

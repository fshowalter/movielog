_He's Just Not That Into You_ is a funny, sometimes insightful, look at relationships that plays well to both men and women.

The plot concerns he interconnected stories of several couples and individuals as they struggle with the various relationships in their lives.

Much of the film's strength comes from the charisma of the ensemble cast. Justin Long, Drew Barrymore, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, and Jennifer Connelly all work well, each able to carry the pieces of their respective storylines. Nobody seems to be mugging for the camera, and no storyline feels overdone just to satisfy a "name" actor.

The script, despite running a few minutes over two hours, is reasonably tight, with several laugh-out-loud moments. Granted, some of the characters feel more like caricatures that real people, but this film isn't about individuals as much as it is about _types_ of individuals and, taken like that, it's perfectly passable. Of course, the shots of Scarlett Johansson in her underwear don't hurt either.

As far as date movies go, _He's Just Not That Into You_ is a good pick, as guys and girls will likely enjoy it, as well as find themselves with something to talk about afterwards. That said, while you're bound to see a little bit of yourself in at least one of the characters, be careful if any of them ring a little _too_ true.

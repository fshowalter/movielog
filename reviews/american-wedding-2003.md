The third entry in the <span data-imdb-id="tt0163651">_American Pie_</span> franchise sees Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) getting married.

_American Wedding_, is less of an ensemble effort than previous entries in the franchise. The rising popularity of Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott and the absence of stars Chris Klein and Mena Suvari probably made this inevitable; and while the change isn't necessarily for the best, it doesn't ruin the movie either.

Fans of the series know what they're in for and this entry delivers more of the same. There are scenes that will have you howling with laughter (and at least one that will likely make you gag), but also long stretches that border on tedious. Fortunately the funny bits are what stick with you.

The strength of the series has always been it's honesty. In the first two entries Jason Biggs's character was the painful everyman who struggled through the adolescence and manhood, and despite the absurdity of the situations, the audience could relate. In _American Wedding_, however, the situations, while still funny, feel a lot more manufactured and as such, lose some of the honesty that made the first two movies more than just a collection of gags.

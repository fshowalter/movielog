There are movies that know exactly what they want to be from the first frame, and then there are movies like _His Kind of Woman_ that stumble into greatness by accident. This 1951 noir begins as a moody, low-key thriller in the Raymond Chandler tradition but gradually transforms into a wonderfully absurd adventure that manages to be both ridiculous and irresistible.

Robert Mitchum plays Dan Milner, a gambler coerced by underworld figures into traveling to a Mexican resort for mysterious purposes. It's a setup we've seen before, but Mitchum inhabits it with his trademark nonchalance. When he walks into his apartment to find three heavies playing cards and asks, "Need a fourth?" we know we're in the hands of an actor who understands the poetry of understatement. Mitchum was born to play a Chandler protagonist—tough, witty, unflappable—and it's a shame he wouldn't get to Philip Marlowe until much later in his career, because he's a dead ringer here.

At the resort, Milner flirts with playgirl Lenore Brent, played by Jane Russell, and befriends ham actor Mark Cardigan, played by Vincent Price. The dialogue crackles with wit. When Mitchum meets Russell drinking expensive champagne in a small Mexican airport cafe, he asks, "You in the oil business, or you just spending your alimony all at once?" Her reply: "I'm what you'd call a spoiled child of the rich." His comeback: "Well, how do you do? I'm what you'd call a spoiled child of the poor." It's not quite Chandler's hard-boiled poetry, but it's just as easy on the ears.

The real revelation here is Vincent Price as the egomaniacal actor Cardigan. Price has always been magnificent playing actors, and here he creates a character who's simultaneously insufferable and endearing--a man-child of considerable ego but medium talent. Price's timing is impeccable, his delivery perfectly calibrated for the back rows of a theater. When he locks Russell in a closet and heads off to rescue Mitchum, someone warns he could be killed. His flamboyant response: "If I'm not here by Wednesday, chop that door down!" 

What makes _His Kind of Woman_ fascinating is how it evolves. The film starts as straight noir but gradually becomes more over-the-top until, by the climax, it's almost absurd--thanks largely to Price's theatrical heroics. Yet Mitchum and Russell play it straight throughout, creating a fascinating tension between the film's realistic and fantastical elements.

The production history explains this schizophrenic quality. Director John Farrow shot the film for producer Howard Hughes, but it sat unreleased for six months. When Hughes finally watched it, he brought in writer Earl Felton and director Richard Fleischer to rework the climax. What was originally a simple scuffle on a yacht became an elaborate chase sequence with burst steam pipes and torture scenes. Hughes kept adding elements--and replacing actors--until the production stretched over a year. By the end, Mitchum's frustration boiled over and he trashed a set.[^1]

This messy production history should have been a recipe for disaster, but instead it created something unique. Neither the somber film noir it starts as nor the absurd action picture it becomes would have been particularly remarkable on their own. Together, they make a truly distinctive film that grows on you with each viewing.

The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Raymond Burr is genuinely menacing as the psychotic mobster Nick Ferraro, who wants to steal Mitchum's identity to re-enter the United States. You'd never know he was the third person to play the role after Hughes decided he didn't like original actor Howard Petrie or replacement Robert J. Wilke.[^2] Rounding out the supporting players, Tim Holt appears as a G-Man, and Jim Backus is perfectly cast as a lecherous investment banker. 

The production values are impressive too--you'd never guess the film was shot entirely on soundstages, complete with a man-made beach.

The film's only real flaw is its length. At just over two hours, it runs a bit long, particularly during the third-act torture sequence, which feels self-indulgent. But this is a minor blemish on what amounts to a happy accident--a film that succeeds not despite its messy production but because of it.

Fulci amps <span data-imdb-id="">_Beatrice Cenci_</span>'s exploitation while dialing back <span data-imdb-id="">_A Lizard in a Woman's Skin_</span>'s avante-gauarde. The resulting thriller set in rural Italy follows a reporter and socialite as they uncover the culprit behind a rash of child murders. It's devloped an unwarranted notorious reputation due to breaking the child-victim taboo. Worth seeking out. I ordered the Arrow Video Blu-Ray for the bonus features.

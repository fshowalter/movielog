A cryogenically frozen 1960s super-spy is revived in the 1990s to once again do battle with his recently thawed nemesis.

_Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_ is a great movie. It's fish-out-of-water plot keeps it from feeling dated, and Mike Myers's kinetic performances propel the film along at a pace that never seems rushed, but never slow either. In short, _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_ holds up to repeat viewings very well.

While a large part of that is due to Myers's performances, he's backed up by a stellar supporting cast, particularly Seth Green and Mindy Sterling who's characters are almost as unforgettable as Myers's.

The movie also looks beautiful. Awash in saturated colors, _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_ has some very memorable costumes, and they actually add to the humor on several occasions.

A prisoner (Sean Connery) struggles with a sadistic guard and a hard-nosed RSM in a North African British military prison during World War II.

_The Hill_ is a solid drama that never quite escapes its stage origins.

From the opening frames, director Sidney Lumet does a great job of establishing atmosphere. Oswald Morris’ crisp black and white photography paints a sharp picture, and you can almost feel the heat emanating from the screen while the titular hill, ever-present, looms ominously over the action.

The performers are uniformly excellent. Sean Connery proves he can handle tough, gritty drama, Harry Andrews is a force of nature as a steel-jawed officer, and Ossie Davis imbues his role with a gentle humanity that almost steals the film.

The problem is that the screenplay by Ray Rigby, from his play with R.S. Allen, is too talky. Despite the great location atmosphere, _The Hill_ still feels like a filmed play, and never really takes advantage of the intimacy afforded by the camera. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it does keep a good film from being a great one.

A retired cat burglar (Cary Grant) finds himself the prime suspect after a rash of copycat thefts.

_To Catch a Thief_ is a magnificent triumph of style over substance. Its lazy plot is shallow and full of holes, but it’s so well played and photographed that it hardly matters.

Director Alfred Hitchcock piles on sly innuendo at every opportunity, never seeming to take the story seriously. Were it anyone but Cary Grant and Grace Kelly on the screen the film might have turned into a lazy, indulgent disaster, but the pair radiates such unmitigated charm that it’s hard to find fault.

The gorgeous Technicolor photography is a feast for the eyes, with oversaturated colors popping out of every frame. Hitchcock makes ample use of the Riviera locales, which, combined with the richness of the color, give the whole film an otherworldly, fairy tale quality.

_To Catch a Thief_ is definitely a film that improves with a second viewing, when the viewer isn’t looking for an intricate plot to follow and can better appreciate the photography and performances. Granted, this is damning praise, but the bottom line is that the film is a very entertaining ride, despite its deficiencies. It may be little more than fluff, but it’s the finest fluff there is.

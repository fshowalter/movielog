A cynical army veteran (Humphrey Bogart) and others are held prisoner in a sweltering Florida hotel by a deported gangster (Edward G. Robinson) during a hurricane.

On the surface, writer-director John Huston proffers a hostage drama, highlighted by the slow-burning tension between Bogart and Bacall. Beneath the surface, he explores post-war disillusionment in America, with Bogart wondering what he fought for and Robinson struggling to understand why everything can't be like it once was.

Robinson shines in a role that Huston originally wanted to cast against type and give to Charles Boyer. A shame, since Boyer or even Cary Grant could have introduced the suave villain years before Alan Rickman did so smashingly in <span data-imdb-id="tt0095016">_Die Hard_</span> in 1988. Still, Robinson plays the part he'd been perfecting for years and nobody does the traditional gangster better.

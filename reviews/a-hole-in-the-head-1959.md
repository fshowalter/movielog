In Miami, a man (Frank Sinatra) struggles to reconcile his big dreams, run-down hotel, free-spirited girlfriend (Carolyn Jones), 12-year-old-son, and stodgy older brother (Edward G. Robinson) with his dwindling finances.

_A Hole in the Head_ is an oddly titled collaboration between star Frank Sinatra and director Frank Capra. Based on the Broadway play of the same name, the film features Sinatra as half swinging bachelor and half widowed family man. The plot, or what little there is, concerns Sinatra's character's schemes to make ends meet while raising his young son. The problem is that, despite a two hour running time, nothing actually happens.

Sure, there are a few peripheral characters, like Sinatra's brother and sister-in-law, played wonderfully by Edward G. Robinson and Thelma Ritter, that have minor arcs, but for the most part, the film just meanders along. It's not so much bad, as it is boring. Even Sinatra's musical numbers, including the popular "High Hopes" feel strangely forced.

This is a situation where the result isn't equal to the sum of its parts. The cast is good, and Capra is a proven director working from established material, yet the result feels aimless and unfinished. There's atmosphere to spare, along with some good character moments, but ultimately there's no story here. The film ends more or less where it begins, which in turn leaves you wondering why it took two hours to get there.

A young woman tries to break into the business world.

_Working Girl_ is an enjoyable, but not spectacular, comedy buoyed largely by Harrison Ford's ample charisma and a great performance from Sigourney Weaver.

Director Mike Nichols makes good use of the New York settings, and seems to have a flair for spotting talent. Look quick for Alec Baldwin, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Spacey in supporting roles.

The script, while not breaking any new ground, does have some good dialog and does a good job making Melanie Griffith's character three dimensional.

Ex-cop Statham punches and shoots his was across New York City as he tries to protect a young girl from rival mobs and a venal New York police department.

Solid, if unremarkable Statham action vehicle features some great location photography and a solid supporting cast highlighted by Chris Sarandon's turn as a corrupt mayor.

While the Civil War rages, an outlaw (Eli Wallach), a mercenary (Lee Van Cleef), and a man with no name (Clint Eastwood) vie for a hidden stash of Confederate gold.

_The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly_ (_Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo_) is an electric, surreal western that stands out as one of the best ever made.

Though it's set during the Civil War, the film doesn't feel like a historical epic, largely because it doesn't look like one. Rather, watching the _The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly_ is like stepping into an alternate world; a nightmarish, apocalyptic vision of the American west transplanted to the deserts of Europe that mixes authenticity with fantasy to create something wholly original.

This is the vision of director Sergio Leone: a world without time, caught in Civil War that will never end, and facing a future that will never come. Against this backdrop, Leone follows the converging stories of the three titular characters, each elevated to near mythical status. It's a very visceral experience, highlighted by Tonino Delli Colli's majestic yet gritty cinematography and punctuated by Ennio Morricone's now legendary score.

This, more than anything, is why, despite it's nearly three hour running time, _The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly_ holds up so well to repeat viewings and ranks as one of the best films of all time.

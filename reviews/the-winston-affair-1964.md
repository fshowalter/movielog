A career officer (Robert Mitchum) in the American military finds himself ordered to defend another officer (Keenan Wynn), who's clearly insane, in the politically charged case of the murder of a British soldier in India.

_Man in the Middle_ is an engaging courtroom drama carried by a solid cast and highlighted by some sharp cinematography.

Robert Mitchum is perfect in the role of a lifetime military man who finds himself in a politically charged situation that gradually forces him to choose between his conscience and his career. He underplays the part well, letting his body language and world-weary eyes tell the story of his moral turmoil.

Supporting Mitchum, the always-solid Trevor Howard delivers a great turn as a military psychiatrist who, having already been put in Mitchum's position, provides Mitchum with a glimpse at his own possible future.

Finally, there's Keenan Wynn, who turns in a frighteningly real performance as a mentally ill soldier whose condition finally comes to a head due to the tense conditions in India.

Directing the proceedings is Guy Hamilton, who would go on to helm several installments of the James Bond franchise. Hamilton moves things along efficiently and keeps the melodrama in check. This, combined with Wilkie Cooper's crisp, black and white Cinemascope photography, makes for a fairly effortless viewing experience.

_Man in the Middle_ may not be a great film, but it is a solid little courtroom drama that should appeal to fans of the genre, as well as fans of star Robert Mitchum.

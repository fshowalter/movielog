Wayne plays a sea captain who, as the film opens, is unconscious, having been knocked out by a treacherous first mate who's been paid to scuttle the ship by an underhanded salvager, played by Raymond Massey.

Wayne is saved by Scarlett O'Hara-clone Goddard and the two fall in love, but things get complicated when a foppish lawyer, played by Milland, enters the picture. Milland falls for Goddard too and soon Wayne's making a deal with the devil in the form of Massey, planning to scuttle his dream ship in return for enough money to ensure he and Goddard can live a good life together. Things don't go as planned, however, and Wayne finds himself on trial for deliberately wrecking the vessel.

Then Wayne and Milland fight a giant squid.

_Reap the Wild Wind_ was director Cecil B. DeMille's answer to <span data-imdb-id="tt0031381">_Gone with the Wind_</span>. He spared no expense. He shot in technicolor. He packed his set pieces with the then-pinnacle of special effects.

But all the gloss can't distract from the wealth of lines delivered by characters gazing at nothing in particular. Nor from a script that goes from a court room sequence to the prosecutor and defendant fighting a sea-monster for evidence. Wayne and Lynne Overman, who plays Loxi's old salt skipper, are the lone bright spots. It's a dull mess of a movie that's only notable today as one of the few instances where Wayne plays a bad guy. Or at least, a good guy gone bad.

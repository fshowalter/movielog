_The Dawn Rider_ is, for better or worse, a fairly unremarkable entry among the westerns John Wayne made for Lone Star Productions.

The story sees Wayne as a cowboy pursuing his father’s killers.

The cast is fine. Marion Burns actually registers as Wayne’s love interest, a rarity among Wayne’s female co-stars in the Lone Star pictures, and Yakima Canutt provides a good villain, though the absence of frequent supporting player George Hayes is noticeable. For his part, Wayne is charming in the lead, though still a little wooden from time to time.

The biggest problem with _The Dawn Rider_ is that it’s got little to recommend it. The stunts by Canutt are middle of the road for the genre, and writer/director Robert N. Bradbury telegraphs his plot in the opening minutes, providing little in the way of suspense or surprise. In a genre known for sacrificing story for action, _The Dawn Rider_ opts to sacrifice action for story, with disappointing results.

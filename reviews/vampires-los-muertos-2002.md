Granted, when a move stars Jon Bon Jovi as a vampire hunter, your expectations are low. Jon has charisma and was great on Ally McBeal, but he also has a finite range and this type of character is outside it. In fact all of the principal roles seem miscast, with the exception of Arly Jover as the vampire antagonist.

Now about that antagonist. I had to look up the character's name in the credits on the <abbr title="Internet Movie Database">IMDB</abbr> (it's Una) because she has absolutely no back-story or characterization. Ditto that for virtually every other character. The little bits we learn about each of them are little more than plot devices, and aren't enough to make characters seem real.

Visually, the movie is average, with faint echos of <span data-imdb-id="tt0093605">_Near Dark_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0116367">_From Dusk Till Dawn_</span> but lacking the style or wit of either.</p>

In spite of all this, the movie moves along fairly, and although you may be tempted near the end, you'll keep your finger off the fast-forward button.

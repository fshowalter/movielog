After another failed year, a vineyard owner (David Niven) returns to his ancestral home with his wife (Deborah Kerr) and children to face ritual sacrifice.

_Eye of the Devil_ has a great cast, lavish production, excellent cinematography, and a proven director; but unfortunately all of these assets are wasted on a weak script.

There's a reasonable thriller here somewhere, and maybe a few more re-writes would have found it, but as it stands we're left with a beautifully produced, well-acted movie that makes little sense and is rarely frightening. In spite of these shortcomings, fans of British horror may still be interested in _Eye of the Devil_, if only for it's cast and cinematography.

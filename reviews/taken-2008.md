_Taken_ is a slick action-thriller that works largely due to the charisma and presence of lead Liam Neeson who, despite being an unlikely action hero, brings a gravitas to the part that helps the film maintain a veneer of credibility.

The story is set in Paris, where a sex-trafficking gang makes the mistake of kidnapping Neeson's estranged daughter. As Neeson, a former CIA operative, informs the gang during a memorable phone call, "If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you."

Director Pierre Morel gives the film a smooth polish, but hyper-edits his action sequences, resulting in at least one car chase that frequently has you wondering which car you're watching, where they're headed, and who's driving.

Aside from that, the film's biggest weakness lies in its decision to play to a PG-13 rating. It's clear this was a marketing, rather than artistic decision, and though the film definitely pushes the rating's envelope, you can't help but feel this film should somehow be fiercer, that Neeson's character should be even more ruthless, and that the dark, seedy, world he trudges through in pursuit of his daughter should be more visceral.

That said, the film does a more than decent job of exploiting its premise, and should please action fans, as well as those eager for another hyper-cut entry in the Bourne franchise. Just be prepared to walk away thinking it could have been something more.

During World War I, a Colonel (Kirk Douglas) defends three troops on trial for cowardice due to a General's blunder.

_Paths of Glory_ is a brilliant anti-war film from director Stanley Kubrick. After two technically masterful, yet ultimately lacking, films in <span data-imdb-id="tt0048254">_Killer's Kiss_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0049406">_The Killing_</span>, Kubrick finally teams up with a leading man capable of commanding attention on screen.

The result is an intense examination of the realities of war as viewed from a class standpoint. It's a thought-provoking film anchored by a solid performance from Douglas, who seems tailor made for a part that, according to the IMDb, almost went to Gregory Peck.

About the only thing wrong with _Paths of Glory_ is that Douglas and the decidedly American cast all play French soldiers. While this is in keeping with the real-life incident on which the story is based, it is ludicrous to think of Douglas as a Frenchman. At least no one tries to fake an accent.

Finally, at only 87 minutes, _Paths of Glory_ is wonderfully tight, telling its story in an efficient, yet powerful manner without resorting to a lot of long-winded monologues or drawn-out courtroom drama. Kubrick's only indulgence comes toward the finale, when he ingeniously halts the film's momentum to force Douglas, and the audience, to see the war from the other side. It's a daring move, but one that serves to drive home his message about the high price of war for the common man.

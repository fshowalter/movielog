Those coming for Christopher Lee beware: his dubbed part amounts to a few minutes of screen time. Further, the story behind how Challnege the Devil came to be proves more interesting than the film’s proffered narrative.

Said narrative sees a group of rampaging young adults wander into a castle where they encounter Lee made up with white hair and mustache to pass for an elderly man. He tells them he’s haunted by his dead wife and if the group can find her so he can give her a proper burial he’ll give them all the riches of the castle. Short on cash and thinking Lee mad, they group agree and set out to search the castle.

Soon they’re lost and tormented by under produced special effects such as fake spider webs and a googled eyed spider. The big finale sees the group enter a room full of crystal walls, meant to be a maze. The performers mime horror and confusion as though lost while ignoring the clearly visible pedestals on the ground holding the glass panels. Production notes reveal director x intended to obscure them perhaps with fog in subsequent reshoots but they never happened.

Why they never happend proves quite the story. X was a first time director and self financed a portion of the film himself by borrowing from family members. The rest of the funds he got by selling the film to production company x.

The film shot under the title Katharisis and after principal photography wrapped x went bankrupt, and its aaaets were bought by another production company, y.

D tried to finish the film, but couldn’t find any more financing. Rather than give him more money Y opted to cut twenty minutes from the film (including a strip tease scene) and shoot a new wrap around sequence invoking gangsters that facilitates voice over narration for the remaining footage.

Lest you worry this is some great loss, fear not. D had grand ambitions of a psychological horror fairy tale but lacked the budget, cast, and talent to execute them. The performers struggle to differentiate themselves. The sets are underfurnished and unimaginatively lit. As mentioned, the special effects are amateurish. The films lone moment of inspiration comes early, as the group arrives at the castle and d proffers a shot of the cars in the courtyard, their headlights like eyes looking toward the ramparts.

For his past, Lee reportedly worked nine days, but based on the final product, I’d be shocked if it was more than two days work. The dubbing robs him of his signature baritone yet he still conveys more screen presence than the rest of the cast.

That said, even Lee die-hards can safely skip this one, as his few minutes offer nothing memorable.

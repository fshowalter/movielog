Answering service operator Holliday falls sight-unseen for client Martin, a self-destructing writer who think's she's a nice old lady he calls "Mom."

The songs are nice, especially Martin's _Just In Time_, and Frank Gorshin's impersonation of Brando is worth a chuckle, but at just over two hours, the film feels at least half an hour too long. There's plenty of plot, but no real drama or character development and it's a testament to the star power of Martin and Holliday that they can hold your interest despite anything _interesting_ happening.

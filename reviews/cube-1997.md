Seven strangers from different walks of life awaken to find themselves trapped in a giant, deadly maze.

_Cube_ is a stylish, but flawed, thriller that works thanks to a relentlessly intriguing premise and solid execution.

What makes Cube so arresting is its refusal to explain itself. You're never told why these people were chosen, where they are, how they got there, anything. Thus, by keeping the viewer as unsure as the characters, the filmmakers invite the viewer to project their own theories onto the situation, just as each of the characters do in the film. It's a brilliant example of less-is-more and is a large part of why the film's so resonant.

Where the film falters, however is in the performances of its leads. They're all too manic. This becomes glaringly apparent on repeat viewings. Granted, you could argue that this is a component of the plot, but it's still handled poorly. What should be a gradual descent into madness feels like a 10-minute free-fall. Applying the same less-is-more principal to the performances would have gone a long way.

Yet, faults and all, _Cube_ is a must see for sci-fi-horror fans. While the dramatic aspects might be mishandled, director Vincenzo Natali and his co-writer Andr√© Bijelic do a fantastic job of exploiting a solid premise that's guaranteed to stay with you long after the credits roll.

A cowboy (John Wayne) goes undercover to investigate a crooked rodeo.

_The Man from Utah_ starts off pretty shaky, utilizing the same laughably bad singing cowboy sequence as the earlier <span data-imdb-id="tt0024500">_Riders of Destiny_</span>. Fortunately, director Robert N. Bradbury drops the signing cowboy angle after this one scene, and delivers an action-mystery that’s one of Wayne’s better Lone Star Productions.

The supporting cast is good. George ‘Gabby’ Hayes plays the Marshall who sends Wayne’s character undercover, and Yakima Canutt plays a strong villain. For Wayne’s romantic lead, Polly Ann Young, while not exactly spectacular, acquits herself better than most of Wayne’s Lone Star leading ladies.

In many ways _The Man from Utah_ is reminiscent of Bradbury’s later effort, <span data-imdb-id="tt0025830">_The Star Packer_</span>. Both involve an undercover John Wayne, and both have a mystery angle to them, though _The Man from Utah_ is a bit higher on the action, with quite a bit of solid stock rodeo footage tossed in as well.

Thus, _The Man from Utah_, while certainly one of Wayne’s “B” westerns, is nonetheless watchable, and pretty good when compared to Wayne’s other Lone Star Productions.

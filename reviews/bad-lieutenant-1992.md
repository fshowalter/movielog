A corrupt New York City police officer (Harvey Keitel) is shaken by a case involving the rape of a young nun.

_Bad Lieutenant_ is one of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. To be sure, it's brilliantly written and performed (Harvey Keitel delivers the performance of a lifetime), but the sheer despair that builds as the titular character spirals further and further into his own abyss is overwhelming.

To say there are no likable characters in _Bad Lieutenant_ is an understatement. You actually despise most of the characters, and the few that you're ambivalent about aren't on the screen long enough to register. This isn't a shortcoming of the movie though, as director Abel Ferrara tells this story with believable characters, and it's the nature of the story that precludes any likable characters.

This makes grading _Bad Lieutenant_ very difficult. As a work of art, _Bad Lieutenant_ is a masterpiece, but it certainly isn't very entertaining. In the end I settled for a middle ground; something I'm glad Ferrara didn't do. The movie's 98 minute running time could have been trimmed by a good 5-10 minutes to make it more digestible while still telling the same story, but it certainly would have lessened the movie's impact.

Human Lanterns may not be a great martial arts movie or a great horror movie, but it proves an intrigueing bridge for Shaw Brothers productions. A trasitional piece between the straightforward kung-fu actioners like The Five Deadly Venoms that launched the studio to worldwide recognition, and the more overt horrors like The Boxer's Omen that saw the studio trying to adjust to changing audience tastes.

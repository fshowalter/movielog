Despite Boris Karloff playing a doctor with a secret underground laboratory where he holds six people hostage as unwilling test subjects, The Man with Nine Lives doesn't work as a mad scientst picture. But it does posit an interesting ethical delema: Would you risk the deaths of six people to save millions?

The story follows X, a doctor working on cryotherapy. He seeks out Karloff's character, who disappeared ten years prior. X and his nurse fiancee, played by Z, travel to Karloff's last known address, "near the Canadian border." The Candadian border looks a lot like southern California.

Anyway, they hire a boat to take them to Karloff's island cabin, and find it overgrown and full of cobwebs. Some weak floorboards reveal a hidden basement and soon they find Karloff frozen in ice in his subterranian laboratory. They thaw him out and Karloff relates the story of how he wound up frozen.

Ten years prior, he'd been treating a wealthy cancer patient, when he was arrested by the local sherrif and brought to the district attourney. Said patient's nephew, eager to claim his inheritance, believes Karloff has murdered his uncle and demands Karloff produce the body. Karloff refuses, but when faced with jail time, relents and agrees to show them his patient provided they don't interfere.

They interfere.

Desparate to save his patient, Karloff whips up a poisonus potiton that--if dropped--will gasify and kill them all within minutes. It drops, and the group retreat into Karloff's ice chamber, where they pass out and freeze.

Flashback over, Karloff realizes the poisonous gas enabled him to survive the ten years and that such a duration would mean an end to cancer, as patients could be frozen until the cancerous cells die off, starved of nutrients. Science-fiction, yes, but stay with me.

They thaw out the other men and Karloff raises the point that they're responsible for his patient's death. The district attourney shrugs this off saying, "in the eyes of the law, we're dead." Another bit of ridiculousness but again, stay with me.

Karloff then reveals he has the formula for the gas and his intention to donate it to science, so that armies of researchers can leverage it to erridcate countless diseases. The thawed nephew, furious he's missed out his inheritence, snatches the formula from Karloff's hands and tosses it into the fire. Karloff shoots him, but it's too late.

Now, the groundwork layed, the film posits its moral dillema: Should Karloff turn himself into the authorities, where he'll sit in jail while he awaits trial and hope for an understanding jury, or try to recreate the formula while it's still fresh in his mind. He'll need test subjects but the experiment will with succeed or kill the subject. Three "dead" men stand available already guilty of murder by neglect.

The film omits the crucial detail for the calculous: What are the chances Karloff can recreate the solution? But we can make some inferences. He has three subjects and a somewhat fresh memory. His first try may only have a 20% chance at succcess, but he'd learn from that mistake an his second might be 50/50. Assuming that fails, he might be as high as 80% for the third and final.

Those are some compelling odds.

Trouble is, the film insists on shoehording in mad scientist tropes. We got lots of shadoy shots of Karloff mixing vials of bubbling and smoking liquids. But this isn't Frankenstein playing God, it's a pragmatic doctor making a choice between two evils.

Karloff plays the part with the right amount of nuance. Allowing his frustration and anger to surface at times but never tipping into meglomania. He's the only three-dimeninsonal character in the picture.

X has no personality and exists only to spout exposition. (A favorite line, when they resovle to find Karloff and Z asks where a town is, he replies, "I don't know, but there's an atlas in this drawer!" before walking over and getting the atlas.)

Speaking of Z, her character's just as one-dimensional. She's there to fall through floors and make soup.
At least she avoids the "hysterical female" trope.

And so, The Man with Nine Lives doesn't may not work as a mad scientist picture, but as a thought experiement, it resonantes. This despite the reductive ending which avoids challenging the audience to make up their own minds, and instead declares Karloff's character "a great man" to a round of applause. Disappointing, but not a total loss and well-worth a look for Karloff fans.

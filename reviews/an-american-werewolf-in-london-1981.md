While on a hiking tour of England, an American (David Naughton) survives a near-fatal assault, only to discover he may be a werewolf.

Until the plot takes over in the third act, _An American Werewolf In London_ manages a perfect blend of black-comedy and horror. From the atmosphere drenched opening through David Naughton’s classic transformation sequence, writer-director John Landis seemingly can do no wrong.

But then, inexplicably, the movie shifts. Landis had been so good about grounding the movie through David Naughton's eyes, but suddenly he has Naughton acting ridiculous, and running from those who would help him. This, in turn, breaks the audience's connection with the character and the movie.

Still, despite this slip, the finale almost makes up for it. It’s clear Landis had this in mind from the get-go, and if he could have found a way for the story to get there organically, _An American Werewolf In London_ would have been perfect.

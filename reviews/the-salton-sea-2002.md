After his wife’s murder, a trumpet player (Val Kilmer) begins a double life as a punk speed junkie.

_The Salton Sea_ features some outstanding performances. Val Kilmer and Vincent D’Onofrio disappear into tricky roles that could easily be over or under done.

The script by Tony Gayton drags from time to time, but the sprinkles of black comedy help to keep things fresh, even if the ending does feel tacked-on and false.

Minor script problems aside, _The Salton Sea_’s other big problem lies in its look and feel. Director D.J. Caruso’s film is just too slick. Should a crack house really look that clean and polished? Shouldn’t it feel a bit more dingy? Even Kilmer’s run down apartment looks more like an antique then the roach-infested hole it should be.

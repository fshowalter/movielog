_Nevada Smith_ sees Steve McQueen play a naive half-Indian who grows into a hardened killer as he searches for his parents' murderers.

The film is really three movies, each representing one of the killers McQueen tracks down.

The first, and easily best, makes up the first half of the film. Brian Keith plays a cynical gun merchant who takes McQueen under his wing, and the interaction between the two is great. Director Henry Hathaway also leverages the majestic landscapes to make the normally larger than life McQueen seem small and vulnerable.

Then, in a ridiculous plot twist that seems designed solely to change the scenery, the film shifts to the swamps of New Orleans and begins to drag. A new supporting cast is introduced, including Pat Hingle, Arthur Kennedy, and Suzanne Pleshette. Unfortunately, her over-emoting ruins the climax of this section, which is already a let down compared to the film’s first half.

Things pick up somewhat for the finale, which, thankfully, doesn’t take place in a swamp. Karl Malden is introduced as the final villain, as McQueen’s transformation from naïve kid to super cool gunfighter is complete. Granted, this section does feel a little plot-driven, but it’s not a total let down.

During the Great Depression, three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson) escape from a chain gang to search for a hidden treasure.

_O Brother, Where Art Thou_ is the Coen brothers' adaptation of Homer’s epic poem, _The Odyssey_. Set in the American south, it also proffers an homage to America’s rural cultural heritage.

From an outstanding soundtrack that manages to appeal to fans outside the genre, to the great use of pop-culture (Woolworth, Dapper Dan), the Coens, taking a cue from Quentin Tarantino’s love notes to the 70s, manage to transform an otherwise unremarkable era into cinematic gold.

The cast shines. George Clooney gives a charming performance as a loveable rogue, while Turturro and Nelson are equally entertaining as his somewhat dim-witted sidekicks.

Supporting them is a stellar array of character actors. Frequent Coen collaborators John Goodman and Stephen Root deliver memorable turns, as does first timer Daniel von Bargen.

The script does a good job of moving through all these characters while still maintaining a cohesive narrative, and even manages to tie everything together with a satisfying ending. Granted, some segments move faster than others, but it never drags for long.

After World War II, three former GIs (Guy Madison, Robert Mitchum, and Bill Williams) have trouble re-acclimating themselves to civilian life.

_Till the End of Time_ is an interesting film for it's era, as it's a rare, early depiction of the troubles faced by soldiers after the war. In so many Hollywood productions, the returning soldier was treated like a conquering hero and behaved as such. Here, the GI's are still, for the most part, treated like heroes, but they struggle to find their place in a world that's moved on without them, and one that's full of people oblivious to their current mental state.

The film's big problem is that, despite Dorothy McGuire getting top billing, this is Guy Madison's picture, and he's simply not very good. He's wooden and flat throughout the entire film, a flaw made even more apparent in his scenes with Robert Mitchum, whose self-destructive ranch hand is easily the highlight of the film. Madison has the all-American look for the part, but not the acting chops to see it through.

The other problem is the ending. Rather than have a somber, but organic and believable ending, the film shoehorns in an abrupt and altogether perplexing ending that seems to say everything will be okay as long as these men can keep fighting bigots. It doesn't make a lot of sense and only serves to undermine much of the film's credibility.

Given these flaws, _Till the End of Time_ will likely appeal chiefly to film buffs looking for an alternative take on the war from Hollywood.

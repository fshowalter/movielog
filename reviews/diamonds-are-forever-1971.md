British agent James Bond (Sean Connery) investigates a diamond smuggling operation that leads to Las Vegas.

_Diamonds are Forever_, the seventh film in the long-running James Bond franchise, marked a return for star Sean Connery after George Lazenby, the star of the previous entry, <span data-imdb-id="tt0064757">_On Her Majesty's Secret Service_</span>, made the ill-advised career move of resigning the role after just one film.

Unfortunately, _Diamonds are Forever_ also marks the point in which the Bond franchise officially "jumps the shark" by going so far towards camp as to be laughable, during a sequence in which Connery drives a car balanced on two wheels in order to navigate a narrow alley.

Oddly, this occurred under the watch of director Guy Hamilton, who'd previously directed the series' best installment up to that point, <span data-imdb-id="tt0058150">_Goldfinger_</span>. But whereas that entry maintained a near perfect balance of spy-thriller and adventure, _Diamonds are Forever_ veers haphazardly between the two, going from a straight smuggling caper to a madcap action comedy and back. The result is a film that's alternately engaging and groan inducing.

That said, there's enough good here to warrant a look from Bond fans, whether it be the inspiration for Will Ferrell's Mustafa character from the <span data-imdb-id="tt0118655">_Austin Powers_</span> films, or Charles Gray's nice take on Blofeld.

Finally, for fans of Las Vegas, the film serves as something of a time capsule, showing the original Circus Circus casino, as well as Freemont St. prior to the renovations and canopy present today.

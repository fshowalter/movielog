Peter Cushing's second film. He has a minor speaking part as one of the Oxford students who hassle Laural and Hardy.

I can appreciate the skill that goes into Laural and Hardy's routines. In this film, Stan performs a three-handed bit that's almost a magic trick. But I never found their comedy funny.

I'll pause for your shocked gasp.

What can I say? I don't like most screwball comedies either. Maybe it's because the humor flows from the characters' myopic self-focus, a trait that irks me. Whatever the reason, it doesn't work for me.

That said, I did enjoy the last few minutes, when Stan--playing against type as a polished nobleman--berates Ollie telling him, "Get your chin up... both of them." That made me chuckle.

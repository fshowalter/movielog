Count Dracula heads to London in order to find the model who's blood can possibly reverse his bride's recent transformation into a black woman.

Yes, you read that synopsis right. _Vampira_, also known as _Old Dracula_, is an awful movie. David Niven must have been desperate for the money because this production is so far beneath his stature it's shameful.

While you could point to the low budget or uninspired direction, the real problem here is the script. It's neither funny, nor entertaining, and ultimately leaves you feeling burned. The movie opens well enough, but quickly degrades into a one-joke premise that never really takes off.

That said, the finale did make me laugh in spite of myself, and Frank Thorton (Captain Peacock from Are You Being Served?) has a small cameo, so I guess that's something, but certainly not worth 88 minutes.

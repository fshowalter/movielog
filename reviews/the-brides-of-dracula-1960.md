A teacher falls prey to a vampire baron in the German countryside.

_The Brides of Dracula_ is s sequel to Hammer’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0051554">_Dracula_</span>. Unfortunately, this entry lacks both Christopher Lee, and a good supporting cast.

Peter Cushing returns as Van Helsing, and does what he can with the weak script. For every step forward it seems to take a step back. For instance, Van Helsing is clever enough to slide his cross across the table to halt the advance of a vampire, but also foolish enough not to pack a spare. And don’t get me started on how he lets a scrawny woman wrestle him to the ground.

Director Terence Fisher adds the usual Hammer touches: good production and great costumes, but is undone by some bad special effects. The wire-bats are laughable at best, and the vampire fangs look like cheap store-bought plastic.

These faults are compounded by the weak supporting cast. David Peel is almost laughable in his purple cape, and Mertita Hunt, who is excellent in the film’s first act, descends into camp before the film’s end.

This one needed Christopher Lee.

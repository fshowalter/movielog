An American tourist (Robert Mitchum) begins an affair with the wife (Deborah Kerr) of a British Earl (Cary Grant).

I'm sure director Stanley Donen is trying to say something with _The Grass Is Greener_, but I'm just not sure what. The story, about Kerr's character having an affair with Mitchum's, while Grant's character politely tries to win her back is neither funny nor romantic. That it's insinuated that Grant's character has also been unfaithful in the past doesn't help either matter.

I'm all for believable, human characters in films, but these characters are hardly believable in their actions and reactions. Further, these characters are barely even _likable_. If it weren't for the innate charisma of the actors portraying them this movie would likely be unbearable.

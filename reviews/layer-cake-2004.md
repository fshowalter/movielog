_Layer Cake_ is a slick, smart, and darkly funny noir that launched the careers of both star Daniel Craig and director Matthew Vaughn.

The plot sees Craig as a successful London drug dealer facing a series of escalating challenges on the eve of his early retirement.

Though Vaughn’s film echoes many of Guy Ritchie’s stylistic touches, J.J. Connolly’s script is more akin to Louis Mellis and David Scinto’s script for Jonathan Glazer’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0203119">_Sexy Beast_</span>, resulting in a film that’s flashier than Glazers, but more resonant than Ritchie’s. A happy medium.

For a first time director, Vaughn acquits himself very well. Though there’s a bit of fat evident here and there, the film is mostly lean, and moves through its story at a good pace. Kudos to Vaughn also, for delivering a near perfect ending that ties the whole film together in a surprising, but wholly satisfying manner.

Finally, there’s Daniel Craig, who’s great as the unnamed lead. Though he didn’t know it at the time, Craig was essentially auditioning for the soon-to-be-vacant role of James Bond, as his suave, ultra-cool performance here isn’t that far removed from his turn as the super-spy.

Coca-Cola's company man (James Cagney) in West Berlin finds himself in hot water when his American boss’s daughter falls for a Communist.

_One, Two, Three_ is a ridiculously fast-paced comedy from writer-director Billy Wilder, highlighted by James Cagney’s farewell performance.

The front of Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond’s screenplay supposedly read, "This piece must be played molto furioso. Suggested speed: 110 miles an hour - on the curves - 140 miles an hour in the straightways,” and Cagney and company do their best to oblige, delivering crisp, rapid-fire dialogue that keeps the film moving along at a breakneck speed. The jokes come fast, and from all angles, but never feel forced, a testament to the dynamic writing of Wilder and Diamond.

The film’s only real weakness is with Pamela Tiffin. Granted, her character isn’t much more than a plot device to begin with, but she’s simply unlikable from the get-go and the film slows considerably whenever she starts leaking her southern drawl.

Still, the rest of the cast more than makes up for this one misstep, and, despite a premise built around the Cold War, the film ages well, and stands up to repeat viewings.

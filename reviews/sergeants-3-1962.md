In the post-Civil War west, three Cavalry sergeants (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Peter Lawford) battle a fanatical, murderous Indian tribe with the help of a trumpet-playing freed slave (Sammy Davis Jr.).

If the plot of _Sergeants 3_ sounds a little familiar that's because it's a remake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0031398">_Gunga Din_</span>, even though W.R. Burnett is, surprisingly, the only credited writer.

That said, the film is really one part competent western adventure courtesy director John Sturges and one part lazy buddy picture courtesy the Rat Pack. The moments these two parts converge are real magic, but unfortunately, they're too few and far between.

Sturges, who'd previously worked with Frank Sinatra in <span data-imdb-id="tt0053108">_Never So Few_</span>, makes the most of the Bryce Canyon locales, framing the action against the expansive vistas, and handles the action sequences with a veteran's ease. Indeed, watching the film you can't help think what shame it was that Sturges didn't end up working with John Wayne until 1974's <span data-imdb-id="tt0071824">_McQ_</span>, which wasn't even a western.

The cast's performances are somewhat mixed. Dean Martin, the only Rat Packer who looks at home in a western, steals the film with a spot-on mix of laconic charm and wry comedy. Sammy Davis Jr. also does a nice job in an underwritten role. Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford however, both look out of place, with Sinatra in particular feeling like an anachronism in the old west. Further, both their performances look tired and phoned in, especially next to Martin and Davis.

While it's not a disaster, _Sergeants 3_ is ultimately nowhere near as fun as <span data-imdb-id="tt0054135">_Ocean's Eleven_</span>, though fans of the Rat Pack will still want to give it a look.

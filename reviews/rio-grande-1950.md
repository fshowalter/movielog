The estranged wife (Maureen O’Hara) and son of a Calvary officer (John Wayne) join him at a fort out west.

_Rio Grande_ was something of a throwaway film for director John Ford. While it’s now considered part of the director’s “Calvary Trilogy,” at the time, Ford made the picture as part of a deal in order to secure financing for his pet project, <span data-imdb-id="tt0045061">_The Quiet Man_</span>. Thus, it’s understandable that _Rio Grande_ is somewhat thinner than Ford’s other Calvary pictures, <span data-imdb-id="tt0041866">_She Wore a Yellow Ribbon_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0040369">_Fort Apache_</span>.

That’s not to say _Rio Grande_ isn’t entertaining, far from it. Leads John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara are dynamite together, and the supporting cast includes great turns by Ben Johnson and Victor McLaglen, both of whom played different characters with the same names in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Ford handles the action well, and the script includes a great, action packed third act that leaves a very pleasant taste in your mouth once the credits roll.

The film’s biggest weakness lies in its length. At 105 minutes it’s a little too long, and sections of the first third can be a little slow, especially the songs, of which there are surprisingly many. While I can understand Ford’s desire to include them to help establish atmosphere, surely he could have found a more visually interesting way to achieve the same effect.

Still, while not the dramatic equal of director John Ford’s other Calvary pictures, _Rio Grande_ is a solid, entertaining western thanks in large part to its great cast.

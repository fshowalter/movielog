A womanizing nightclub singer (Frank Sinatra) finds a meal ticket in a rich widow (Rita Hayworth) but can't shake his attraction to a chorus girl (Kim Novak).

_Pal Joey_ is a solid musical drama, boosted by great performances from its three leads, particularly Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak.

Though it's sold as a musical, it's really more of a drama. With the exception of one ill-advised number by Rita Hayworth and another awkward bit by Sinatra toward the film's end, no character breaks out into song for no apparent reason. In fact, all the songs are sung by performers playing singers, and thus they feel like a natural part of the story. Further, some of the numbers, like Sinatra's private performance of "The Lady is a Tramp" for Hayworth's character are real highlights.

Unfortunately, while _Pal Joey_ is pretty entertaining, you can't help feeling that it's a bit watered down. The titular character lacks edge, neither too smooth nor too cold, which keeps the film from really packing any sort of emotional punch. It's a real shame, as the premise is solid and deserving of a more honest approach. Further, the Hayworth number, where she breaks into song alone in her bedroom, could go, as could Sinatra's odd daydream sequence toward the end. Both feel like fluff and only serve to pad the running time.

That said, Kim Novak is amazing. She nearly steals the film from Sinatra with her perfect mix of innocence, sexuality and self assurance, and it's easy to see why director Alfred Hitchcock cast her opposite James Stewart in <span data-imdb-id="tt0052357">_Vertigo_</span> one year later. Her performance, combined with Sinatra's makes Pal Joey worth a look.

A Miami detective (Frank Sinatra) gets to the bottom of a case involving a blonde at the bottom of the ocean in this sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0062380">_Tony Rome_</span>.

_Lady in Cement_ is another adventure of Miami detective Tony Rome following his eponymous debut. It's not a good film, but it's not a glaringly awful one either. Lead Frank Sinatra maintains just enough interest in the proceeding to hold our attention, but not enough to make us actually care what's happening. Still, Ole Blue Eyes' charm goes a long way.

The aforementioned charm, Raquel Welch's easy nature on the eyes, and the great Miami location photography are about all the film has going for it, but it plays to its strengths. The plots a little convoluted, with more than a few holes, but, like the performances from the cast, it could be a lot worse.

And that's the rub, because it could also be a lot better. Sinatra can play the hardboiled, world-weary detective, and the bright, sex-soaked Miami scenery makes a great contrast against its seedy underbelly. Further, the basic plot elements of the story are all solid. All the movie really needs is a couple of script polishes, and a cast and crew willing and able to take it seriously.

But unfortunately, we're left with a half-assed effort that, while watchable, will undoubtedly leave you wanting.

A Memphis pimp tries to escape his life by breaking into hip-hop.

_Hustle and Flow_ is a solid--albeit predictable--movie. Director Craig Brewer infuses a dirty realism that permeates from the opening scene, and the performances (esp Terrance Howard) are superb.

Unfortunately, there are a few weak spots. The great sense of realism also highlights the more convenient aspects of the plot (like DJ Qualls's character), and some scenes run a bit long, but these are really nit-picks.

For me though, _Hustle and Flow_ suffers because the story is so obvious. You know what's going to happen going in, and thus, the movie is solely about the journey. While this won't bother some people, it does knock a letter grade for me.

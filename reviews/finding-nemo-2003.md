The voice acting is fine, the animation is spectacular; it's a definite improvement for Pixar over <span data-imdb-id="tt0198781">_Monsters, Inc._</span>.

My biggest complaint is that unlike <span data-imdb-id="tt0114709">_Toy Story_</span> or <span data-imdb-id="tt0120623">_A Bug's Life_</span> these characters just aren't as memorable. Admittedly, it isn't fair to compare one film against another, but I can't help but think they could have done better. In fact, some of the best characters in the film (the sharks, the turtles, that little crustacean in the fish tank) have such small parts they barely register before they're gone.

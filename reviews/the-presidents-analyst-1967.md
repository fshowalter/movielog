A psychiatrist (James Coburn) treating the President of the United States finds himself the target of competing government agencies and various foreign governments, all seeking the knowledge he holds.

_The President's Analyst_ is a good satire that is, unfortunately, aging rapidly. Current generations will likely miss certain references, and later ones will have an even harder time appreciating the Cold War paranoia and G-man jabs.

That said, this is a film to enjoy while you can. Playing everything with a straight face, even as the film gets more and more absurd as it unwinds, James Coburn makes a difficult role look easy. He's simultaneously an everyman and an exceptional man, allowing us to root for him and, at the same time, swallow the ridiculous plot.

Further, the film's willingness to address many controversial topics, like liberal guilt, racism, world relations, and the counter-culture movement, make for some biting comedy, such as the liberal gun owners eager for a mugging so they can vent their pent-up rage, or the universally short, clean cut G-men that all talk in monotone.

Ultimately, while it may not age anywhere near as well as <span data-imdb-id="">_Dr. Strangelove_</span>, it's still worth a look, especially for fans of Kubrick's classic. Just donâ€™t wait too long to see it.

Boris Karloff delivers a thoughtfully restrained performance in this first _Mr. Wong_ film, though it sees him once again playing an East-Asian character.

In 1938, inspired by the success of Fox's _Charlie Chan_ and _Mr. Moto_ series, poverty row studio Monogram optioned the popular "James Lee Wong" stories that had appeared in _Collier's_ magazine in 1934, and approached Boris Karloff to star.

Karloff, enticed by the prospect of starring in a non-horror role, agreed, and signed a four-picture deal, with _Mr. Wong, Detective_ being the first.

Set in San Francisco, the plot concerns the locked-room murder of a chemical company executive. Wong aids the inept police captain, played by Grant Withers, in the investigation. As more locked-room bodies pile up, Wong realizes the key lies in glass bulbs of poisonous gas, and hatches a plan to catch the culprits.

Aside from the makeup narrowing his eyelids, and occasional dressing gown, Karloff avoids any stereotypes. No accents, broken English, or esoteric customs. His East-Asian heritage is matter-of-fact. Karloff's Wong is an erudite, Ivy League educated scientist who moonlights as a detective (or vice-versa). Think Sherlock Holmes minus the arrogance.

It's a good performance from Karloff that deserved a better script. While I appreciated the glass blowing sequence, Karloff's character meanders through the muddled plot and only reaches his solution after most of the suspects are dead.
Worst of all, as mysteries go, it's a let-down, as, in reaching for its final twist, proffers a resolution that falls apart at the slightest introspection.

Keeping the running time to just over an hour, director William Nigh does his best to plow through the lengthy setup and frequent exposition dumps, but offers nothing in the way of inspired visuals or dynamic camera work.

Thus, saddled with a tepid script and workman-like direction, Karloff has little to work with. A better sidekick might have helped. Withers doesn't grate, but he's no Eugene Pallette or Nigel Bruce.

All this relegates the film to Karloff completists, who should appreciate his restrained performance, even as they wish it was in service of better material.

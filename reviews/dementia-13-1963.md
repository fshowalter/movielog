Axe murders plague a group of mourners at an Irish castle.

_Dementia 13_ is most notable as one of the first credited directorial efforts from Oscar winning director Francis Ford Coppola.

That said, Coppola shot the film while he was assisting Roger Corman on <span data-imdb-id="tt0057706">_The Young Racers_</span> and it shows. _Dementia 13_ plays like a Corman picture, with a few interspersed moments of inspiration.

The cast (borrowed from the Corman picture) is fairly unremarkable, with the exception of Patrick Magee who makes a sizable impression as a somewhat unhinged doctor.

Where Coppolaâ€™s film shines though, is where he diverts from the standard Corman formula, such as the excellent underwater scenes. While these moments are rare, the brief 75-minute running time is some compensation.

A socially challenged high-school misfit helps his lone friend run for class president.

The opening credits of _Napoleon Dynamite_ immediately bring to mind Wes Anderson's <span data-imdb-id="tt0128445">_Rushmore_</span>, but where _Rushmore_ had passion and charm, _Napoleon Dynamite_ has none.

_Napoleon Dynamite_ is a mean movie. Rather than being a simple social misfit, the titular character seems to have real development issues, and thus, laughing at him just feels mean. Other characters have similar issues, and with the exception of Diedrich Bader's cameo--which is easily the film's highligh--there are _no_ enjoyable characters in the entire movie.

This is because the filmmakers play the satire so straight it could pass for drama. A slightly more exaggerated approach may have helped, but in the end the movie feels like one of those overlong _Saturday Night Live_ sketches that are more uncomfortable than funny. You're tired of these characters long before the movie ends, and are left with no desire to revisit them.

That said, some will undoubtedly have no problem with the humor of this film and really enjoy it, but I'm not one of them.

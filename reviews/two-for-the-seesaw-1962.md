Robert Mitchum plays a middle-aged, midwestern lawyer who abandons his cushy job and pampered lifestyle for New York Ciy after his wife of twelve years asks for a divorce. He meets a late-twenty-something dancer played by Shirley MacLaine. A romance blooms. Spoilers follow.

First, the good. The opening scenes following Mitchum on the Brooklyn bridge and wandering the New York streets evoke a terrific atmosphere. They frame the city as both bustling and isolating—the alluring enigma that’s attracted generations of transplants. They also serve as an intriguing time-capsule—notice the big Brookhattan sign.

But these same scenes betray the film’s biggest problem. Seeing Mitchum take a big sigh on the bridge, mope around town, take a big sigh at the Met, mope around town some more—I couldn’t buy it.

Mitchum oozes a laconic confidence, yet his character comes to New York City suffering a mid-life crisis, seeking to prove to himself he can stand on his own after living a coddled, cushy lifestyle financed by his wife’s father.

I couldn’t buy Mitchum as lonely or anxious. Like Dean Martin, his cool comes from his innate detachment. The sense that he knows he’ll be fine no matter what happens and thus doesn’t care.

Casting Mitchum in this role is like casting him in Jack Lemmon’s part in the Apartment—or casting Lemmon in Mitchum’s part in Cape Fear.

Lemmon would have shined in this role. So would a younger Henry Fonda. I was surprised to learn the film originated as a stage-play wth Fonda and Anne Bancroft as the leads. A fifty-seven-year-old Fonda wouldn’t have worked in this film, but a thirty-seven-year-old one would have been dynamite.

All that said, Mitchum and MacLaine have solid chemistry. You may struggle to understand what her character would see in his character, but you can understand what Shirley MacLaine would see in Robert Mitchum.

And Mitchum’s miscasting lends the ending an unexpected resonance. While the script attempts to restore the social norms, Mitchum’s innate nature betrays any sense of hope. What’s supposed to seem bitter-sweet—Mitchum returning to a fresh-start with his ex-wife—takes on nihilistic undertones thanks to his detachment. We can’t see it working out with his ex-wife any more than it could with MacLaine’s character. He’s trapped and knows it.

This reframes MacLaine’s character’s ending. Without buying that Mitchum has changed, we can’t believe MacLaine has either. She’s doomed to repeat her cycle of falling for broken men who abuse her selfless generosity.

Quite the fatalistic perspective for a high-profile studio picture. I wonder how contemporary audiences reacted. Modern audiences may chafe at Mitchum’s overt chauvinism, but MacLaine’s reactions shows how such behavior was acceptable at the time.

I can’t recommend Two for the Seesaw, but I can’t recommend against it either. It’s a flawed picture but flawed in a way that lends an unexpected depth. Not one I’d suggest seeking out—given the two hour running time—but worth considering if you’ve exhausted Mitchum and MacLaine’s better efforts.

Racer Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) finds his life turned upside down by the arrival of a French driver (Sacha Baron Cohen).

_Talladega Nights_ could be considered an in-spirit sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0357413">_Anchorman_</span>, but where as the former is all bubble-gum, _Talladega Nights_ tries to go a little deeper and tell a genuine story about a boy and his father. Unfortunately the movie can't change gears as smoothly as its title character and you can almost hear the transmission grinding whenever the movie tries to take itself seriously.

That's not to say its all bad. As a satire of middle-class America, _Talladega Nights_ works very well, and if the creators had chosen this as the meat of their movie, the end result might have been a classic. Instead you've got some great laughs broken up by a b-movie drama.

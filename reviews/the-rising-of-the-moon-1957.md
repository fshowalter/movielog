Power introduces a trio of Irish vignettes, the first about a reluctant policeman's arrest of a proud, old-fashioned man for assault, the second about a train's prolonged layover in small railways station, and the last about the escape of an Irish Nationalist before his planned execution.

Ford's attempt to recapture the romanticized Irish life he presented so well in <span data-imdb-id="tt0045061">_The Quiet Man_</span> falls short, as his reverence for the source material and cast blinds him to the rambling narratives and stiff performances.

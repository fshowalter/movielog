Sprawling drama sees Mitchum as the wealthiest and most powerful man in his small southern town whose womanizing ways have driven a wedge between himself and estranged wife Parker. Hamilton plays their sheltered son and the plot kicks in when Mitchum decides to take over raising the boy in an attempt to make Hamilton more like Mitchum's trusted ranch hand, Rafe, played by Peppard.

Well produced with beautiful location photography, backed by an involving script, and featuring a terrific performance from Peppard, who steals the film. The sole blemish is Hamilton, who can't help but seem stilted next to the laconic Mitchum and impossibly charming Peppard.

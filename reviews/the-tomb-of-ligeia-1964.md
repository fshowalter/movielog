A nobleman (Vincent Price) becomes obsessed with the idea that his dead wife still lives.

_The Tomb of Ligeia_ was the last of director Roger Corman’s Edgar Allen Poe adaptations. It starts out well enough, eschewing the soundstages that had been common in his previous adaptations for some real outdoor shots that give the movie a breath of fresh air. Vincent Price delivers enough of a twist on his traditional tortured-nobleman performance to keep things fresh as well.

Unfortunately, after a promising first act, the movie starts to drag. Screenwriter Robert Towne doesn’t give anyone much to do except avoid a black cat that can leap tall buildings in a single bound. It’s a real shame too, because the cast is solid and Corman’s willingness to play with the formula could have produced something special.

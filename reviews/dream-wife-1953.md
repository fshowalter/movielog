A diplomat (Deborah Kerr) plays chaperone while her ex-fiancé (Cary Grant) courts an Arab princess.

_Dream Wife_ is an airy comedy featuring two very likable stars in Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Unfortunately, it’s just not very funny.

Director Sidney Sheldon goes for cheap laughs when dealing with Arabic culture and fails at every turn. The Arabs cover their hotel room in sheets and send crates of goats as a dowry, yet get off the plane to New York wearing western clothes and asking for hot dogs.

Further, the script, credited to three writers including Sheldon, builds interesting premise dealing with a woman's role in 1950s society, but just when it has a chance to make an actual statement, it crumbles into a very implausible yet formulaic romantic comedy that ages poorly.

It’s a shame because _Dream Wife_ has a lot of talent in front of the camera. Both Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are in fine form here, and the supporting cast is good too, especially Walter Pidgeon, but there simply isn’t enough good material for them to work with.

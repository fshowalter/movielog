A newlywed couple enjoys a honeymoon at the beach, but after one is attacked by a mysterious man things begin to take a turn for the worse.

_Zombie Honeymoon_ starts off much as you'd expect from a film titled "Zombie Honeymoon." It's over-the-top, zany and a bit cartoonish, but once the horror elements kick in, the film takes a sharp turn, changes gears, and evolves into a serious mediation on what it means to love someone and the lengths you'll go to for that special person. Yes, this with a title like "Zombie Honeymoon."

While this tonal shift may be off-putting for those expecting a more tongue-in-cheek, <span data-imdb-id="tt0365748">_Shaun of the Dead_</span> approach, those that go with it will find themselves rewarded with a solid, serious little drama. Writer/director David Gebroe crafts an extreme example of a destructive relationship, focusing on the fine line between loving someone and being an enabler, only here, he's substituted zombies for addiction.

And it's a brilliant twist as, unlike the usual vampire-addiction metaphor, as it makes the afflicted party simultaneously more sympathetic and repulsive as they slowly devolve into a shambling corpse driven to feed on living flesh.

Unfortunately, the film's biggest weakness lies in its budget. While the special effects are fine (and very gory), the digital video production feels cheap and shoddy. Gebroe makes the most of his medium, but it can't substitute for film. Further, while his lead Tracy Coogan does a fine job, the rest of the cast is no where near as solid, ranging from passable to totally forgettableâ€”likely, more fallout from the non-existent budget.

But, taken for what it is, _Zombie Honeymoon_ represents an impressive effort. It never quite overcomes its budget, but it does manage to distract you from it for long stretches of time.

Slimy politician Vaughn hand picks well-regarded San Francisco cop McQueen to guard a mob witness. When things go south, McQueen won't stop until he finds out why.

Yes, there's an amazing car chase (possibly the best ever filmed) but it's McQueen's performance that makes the movie. He's so damn good as a driven, emotionally distant, world-weary cop that you can easily forgive Bisset's window-dressing role and the too long ending. If ever there was a movie for guys who like movies, this is it.

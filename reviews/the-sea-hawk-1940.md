A 16th century privateer (Errol Flynn) raids Spanish ships for the good of England.

_The Sea Hawk_ takes everything that was great about <span data-imdb-id="tt0026174">_Captain Blood_</span> and throws in a Dracula-looking Claude Rains, a better score, and significantly better production values. Only Olivia de Havilland is noticeably missing, and while Brenda Marshall is adequate as Flynn's love interest she's no match for de Havilland in terms of screen presence.

Fortunately, director Michael Curtiz seems to have realized this, as the love story is placed well on the back burner and instead we're treated to sea battles, jungle ambushes, and some of the best swashbuckling ever filmed.

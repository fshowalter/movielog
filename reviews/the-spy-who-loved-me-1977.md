British spy James Bond (Roger Moore) teams with a Soviet agent (Barbara Bach) to investigate a series of submarine hijackings and avoid a steel-toothed assassin (Richard Kiel).

_The Spy Who Loved Me_ is the tenth entry in the long running James Bond series, and the third for star Roger Moore. This was the first time the series used a completely original story, as only the title, and the inspiration for two villains came from Ian Fleming's source novel. Fortunately, the screenwriters managed to craft a solid spy thriller that finally gives Moore a movie comparable to some of the early Connery vehicles.

Much of this success is due to the one-two punch of Curd Jürgens and Richard Kiel as the story's villains. Jürgens is solid as a megalomaniac shipping magnate, and Kiel is great as the now iconic henchman, Jaws. Indeed, despite having no lines, Jaws is a great villain in the comic-book sense, and yet, by using him as an unstoppable, ever-stalking menace, the filmmakers mitigate any camp, thus making him a legitimate threat.

Toss in some great location photography, a good performance from Barbara Bach as the Soviet agent assigned to work with Bond, and more than a few good action sequences and you've got a solid adventure/thriller. While _The Spy Who Loved Me_ may not be the best in the series, it's certainly one of Moore's best and worth a look for Bond fans.

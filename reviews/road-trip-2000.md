College friends take a road trip from New York to Texas.

_Road Trip_ is an enjoyable comedy. While the jokes are hit or miss, most will at least make you chuckle and a few will even get you rolling. Writer-director Todd Philips shows some restraint, usually opting for character-based humor rather than the easy gross-out joke. Granted, he slips once or twice (and these gags donâ€™t stand up to repeat viewings as well as the character bits) but not enough to ruin the movie.

The cast is great. Seann William Scott steals all his scenes in a group that has real chemistry. The female leads, while not given much to do, are charming as well, and the various cameos are all entertaining.

Gangster Bogart muscles into the freight business, forcing trucker Brent to either work for the syndicate or not work at all.

Though Bogart gets top billing, this is Brent's movie and he plays it like a flat, poor-man's George Raft. The script doesn't help, coming across as more of an anti-mob propaganda piece than a believable story. Watch <span data-imdb-id="tt0033149">_They Drive by Night_</span> instead.

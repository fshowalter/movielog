After being bitten, an Oklahoma youth is abducted by a roving group of vampires.

_Near Dark_ is a modest western-horror buoyed by a strong cast. While Adrian Pasdar does a descent job in the lead, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and especially Joshua John Miller steal the show as amoral--but still relatable--vampires.

Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow does a great job of grounding the story in a dusty reality (the word “vampire” is never used) and handles the gorier aspects of the story with aplomb. Instead of drenching the film in blood, she saves it for a few key scenes and then uses it to hammer home the vampire’s vicious nature.

Unfortunately _Near Dark_ has one really big flaw. After going through all the trouble of keeping the film grounded in a plausible reality, Bigelow expects the audience to believe that a simple home transfusion is all you need to cure vampirism. Sure, a little nick on the neck will turn you in a matter of hours, but a quick transfusion in the barn will have you right as rain.

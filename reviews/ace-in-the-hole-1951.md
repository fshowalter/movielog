An ambitious, unscrupulous reporter (Kirk Douglas) manipulates the rescue of a man trapped in a cave in order to milk the story for his own gain, and in the process, creates a media circus.

_Ace in the Hole_ explores the same themes of exploitative media as the inferior <span data-imdb-id="tt0021873">_Five Star Final_</span>, but does so as a film noir, as opposed to a sappy melodrama.

Director Billy Wilder's script, along with Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, is a dark, biting look at one man's unabashed egotism and the collateral damage he leaves in his wake. Kirk Douglas is fearless in the role, creating a character that's simultaneously charming and slimy, he's someone you want to hate, but remain interested in.

Opposite Douglas, Jan Sterling matches his icy, self-centered nature, but never quite worms her way into your graces the way Douglas does. It's not a fatal flaw, but it does weaken the story's impact.

That aside, _Ace in the Hole_'s real problem is its somewhat abrupt ending, specifically a third act twist involving the fate of Douglas' character. It feels too artificial, and indeed, Wilder and company were likely forced into it in order to appease the censors, but nonetheless, the result is an ending that feels too neat, too safe, and too forced.

Still, despite this flaw, _Ace in the Hole_ is a solid film-noir and definitely worth a look, especially for fans of the genre, who will undoubtedly appreciate the lack of detectives.

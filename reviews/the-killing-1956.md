An ex-con (Sterling Hayden) masterminds a daring racetrack robbery.

_The Killing_ is, in many ways, an evolution of John Huston’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0042208">_The Asphalt Jungle_</span>. Both are heist pictures, and both star Sterling Hayden, but director Stanley Kubrick puts his own stamp on The Killing by telling the story in a non-linear fashion, zigzagging back and forth in the timeline to show how the various pieces of the crime came together.

The result is a technically solid, and groundbreaking, film, that helped bridge the gap between Huston’s _The Asphalt Jungle_ and modern films such as Quentin Tarantino’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0105236">_Reservoir Dogs_</span>.

Unfortunately, _The Killing_ suffers from some awful voice-over narration (supposedly studio-mandated) and a lot of expository dialog. These two combine to give the film a very Dragnet-esque feel that ends up robbing the film of much of its edge. Compounding this is a solid, but unspectacular cast that does little to elevate the story. The biggest star here is Kubrick himself, with his meticulous attention to detail and inventive camera work.

Had _The Killing_ been made later in Kubrick’s career, when he could attract big name talent and command a larger budget, it would likely rank as one of his finest pictures, but as is, it’ll likely appeal to genre fans and Kubrick aficionados only.

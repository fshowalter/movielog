Following a bitter breakup, a couple (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) undergo a procedure to erase all memories of the other person from their minds.

_Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ is an interesting take on relationships and the nature of maturation. Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman craft a spiraling, mobius strip story that hinges on an outlandish premise, yet never become too enamored with their own cleverness. This is, first and foremost, a story about what it means to be human, and all the quirks and special effects exist only to explore that theme from unusual angles.

And, of course, the great cast doesn't hurt. Jim Carrey, as Joel, proves once again that he's more than just a gifted physical comic and Kate Winslet forces you to care about the charming, but free-spirited Clementine. The pair has a believable, but not too saccharine, chemistry that's crucial to the film's success.

Yet, the film isn't perfect, which may be a fault of its own ambitions. A scene where Carrey retreats into a childhood memory is jarring. This type of scene works better on paper than on screen, and while Gondry should be applauded for trying, he misses the mark nonetheless.

That said, it's a minor hiccup in an otherwise great film. One that makes its point, that without memories we can never learn from our past and thus end up doomed to repeat it, in an eloquent, but convincing manner that will have you pondering the questions the film raises long after you've left the theater.

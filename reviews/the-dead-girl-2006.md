_The Dead Girl_ is sad movie.

Its tagline is “One life ends. Seven others begin.” but this is misleading. No lives really “begin”; they just transition from one broken or scarred state to another. None of the characters are likable and, because the film is broken into five different stories, none have any real arc and so the film has no real payoff. While this may have been cathartic for the filmmaker, as a viewer it’s almost masochistic.

Granted the performances are, for the most part, measured and true, and the script provides believable dialog for difficult situations, but neither of these can overcome the fact that the movie isn’t really _about_ anything, just five intersecting stories revolving around the discovery of a dead girl’s body.

If it’s sad you want, watch <span data-imdb-id="tt0180093">_Requiem for a Dream_</span> instead.

After his medicine show runs afoul of the local law, a drifter (William Holden) winds up caring for a group of orphaned children.

_Father Is a Bachelor_ is notable for four things. First, the film opens with William Holden in blackface lip-synching a tune with Dooley Wilson (of _Casablanca_ fame) accompanying him, second, it marks the first, and only musical of Holden's career (thankfully), third, it was written by James Edward Grant, who wrote a good number of John Wayne's scripts, and finally, the predominantly child cast isn't half bad.

While seeing Holden in blackface is certainly a shock (and likely what keeps the film from being released on home video), it's the young cast that's ultimately most surprising. Gary Gray, who just two years earlier over-emoted terribly in <span data-imdb-id="tt0040720">_Rachel and the Stranger_</span> comes across just fine here. Ditto Mary Jane Saunders who manages to be cute without being cloying.

Indeed, what undoes _Father Is a Bachelor_ is not the child actors, but rather the filmmaker's insistence on having Holden break out into song at various intervals. Given that he's not a singer, why cast him in a role that clearly called for one? This would have been a much better vehicle for Frank Sinatra, whose career was waning about this point before his resurgence with <span data-imdb-id="tt0045793">_From Here to Eternity_</span>.

That said, this isn't a bad movie. At 83 minutes, it goes by pretty easily, but it's nothing you'll need, or want, to see again.

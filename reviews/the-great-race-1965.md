Blake Edwards's live-action cartoon features Curtis and Lemmon as rival daredevil showmen competing in a car race from New York to Paris.

While overlong, the bits all age well and Lemmon is fearless as Professor Fate. Watch out for the print on TCM, it's cropped to 1.85:1 which chops off some of the Panavision 2.35:1 image.

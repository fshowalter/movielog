The distant cousin (Vincent Price) of a young farm girl (Gene Tierney) invites her to live in his gothic mansion as a companion for his young daughter.

Though Vincent Price didn't know it at the time, _Dragonwyck_ was something of a warm-up for the gothic horror films he would later become synonymous with. While this film is certainly a step up from most of those later movies, it will likely remind many of Price's Edgar Allan Poe adaptations with Roger Corman, particularly <span data-imdb-id="tt0053925">_House of Usher_</span>.

_Dragonwyck_ also marked the directorial debut of writer Joseph L. Mankeiwicz, who delivers a well-produced, atmospheric piece featuring a surprisingly strong supporting cast including Walter Huston as lead Gene Tierney's bible-thumping father, and Jessica Tandy, in only her sixth credited film. Indeed, the supporting cast overshadows Tierney herself, who seems a little too artificial in the role.

That said, _Dragonwyck_ is definitely worth a look for fans of Vincent Price. While some will undoubtedly consider this a poor man's <span data-imdb-id="tt0032976">_Rebecca_</span>, Price's performance makes it worthwhile. Incredibly, Gregory Peck was rumored as the first choice for Price's role, but allegedly dropped out when original director Ernst Lubitsch fell ill and had to be replaced.

Super spy and renaissance Ã¼ber man, Derek Flint saves the world from a cabal of women seeking to take over the world by replacing the president and brainwashing women with hairdryers.

An even more ridiculous retread of the earlier <span data-imdb-id="tt0059557">_Our Man Flint_</span> that works thanks to Coburn's deadpan performance as Flint, which is still a lot of fun, though the decision to dress straight-man Cobb in drag nearly sinks the film.

An aging Elvis who never actually died battles an undead mummy in a Texas nursing home with a fellow resident who believes himself to be J.F.K.

_Bubba Ho-Tep_ is an amalgam of comedy, horror, and social commentary that results in one of the most original movies in years.

The script by director Don Coscarelli (adapted from a short story by Joe R. Lansdale) is really a mediation on fame and it's effects. The comedy is mainly a byproduct and never feels forced or flat, and the horror element is simultaneously a metaphor and a plot device. The genius of the script is that these elements are woven together so deftly, that a viewer can enjoy Bubba Ho-tep as a comedy-horror film, without ever acknowledging the deeper themes beneath it.

The whole movie rides on Bruce Campbell's performance as an aging Elivs. It's a crucial role: too much and the audience sees it as no more than a man doing an Elvis impersonation, too little and the audience never believes that the man on the screen is the crumbling ruin of an icon. Thankfully, Campbell rises to the occasion showing surprising range and restraint. His performance is absolutely believable from the moment we see him.

_Bubba Ho-Tep_ isn't perfect though. It does take a bit too long to pick up steam, and some of the effects betray the films low-budget, but given it's refreshing originality, these are easily overlooked.

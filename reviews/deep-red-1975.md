After witnessing a murder, a pianist teams with a reporter to find the killer.

_Deep Red_ (_Profondo rosso_) is a taut, well-photographed thriller.

Director Dario Argento’s sharp compositions are highlighted by his wonderful use of color, creating a truly signature look. Further, his innovative use of the camera elevates this film above the genre standard.

The film is relentlessly unsettling. Argento ratchets up the tension to almost unbearable levels and never resorts to cheap “Boo!” scares for the payoff. While the violence will no doubt be off-putting for some, Argento and co-writer Bernardino Zapponi’s use of relatable sensations makes many of the scenes _feel_ harsher than they really are.

The soundtrack by the band Goblin is sometimes distracting, but when it does work, it works exceptionally well. The haunting piano and echoing drums were one of the inspirations for John Carpenter and his classic <span data-imdb-id="tt0077651">_Halloween_</span> score.

It should be noted that the US release of _Deep Red_ is almost a half hour shorter than the International version, and I actually prefer it. Excised is much of the romance between David Hemmings’s and Daria Nicolodi’s characters, and several bits of comedic dialog. The result is a much more intense film, with tighter pacing and less “down time” for the audience. Granted, much of the plot is never fully explained, but it doesn’t detract from the experience.

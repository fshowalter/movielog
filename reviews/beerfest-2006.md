_Beerfest_ is an irreverent, funny, and highly entertaining film from the Broken Lizard comedy troupe.

The plot sees the troupe train to represent the United States in a top-secret, international beer drinking competition held in Germany.

Chock full of high school and college humor, the film makes little attempt to pass itself off as sophisticated fare. Yet, there are more than a few inspired moments, such as Jürgen Prochnow's reference to his role in <span data-imdb-id="tt0082096">_Das Boot_</span>, or Donald Sutherland's cameo, or Cloris Leachman's entire performance. Moreover, beneath the gross out gags, and outrageous beer stunts, there's a subtle meditation on male camaraderie that echoes, of all things, many of the films of Howard Hawks.

Indeed, it's this underlying vibe that makes the film hold up so well to repeat viewings. It's a male fantasy—hanging out with your buddies, drinking beer, horsing around—and for 110 minutes, you live it while watching the film. You like these guys, and want to hang out with them and be part of the gang, and it's not so much a strength of the script as it is a reflection of the chemistry of the performers.

That said, the _Beerfest_ will undoubtedly play better to men than women, and thirty something or older men in particular, as this movie is essentially an escapist fantasy from everyday family life. Thus, those outside this particular demographic may want to skip it, but for the rest, it's a must see.

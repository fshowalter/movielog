After being found guilty of treason, a renowned brain surgeon (Boris Karloff) is sentenced to hard labor on the Devil’s Island penal colony.

_Devil’s Island_ is a solid little movie featuring a novel turn by Boris Karloff.

Karloff, renowned for his more sinister roles, plays the hero here and pulls it off quite well. He seems aware of his range and maximizes his presence without overacting.

Opposite Karloff, James Stephenson turns in a satisfyingly low-key performance as an amoral warden.

While the script is a mostly by-the-numbers affair with a social commentary slant, the film's brief 62-minute running time keeps it from wearing out its welcome. While it’s certainly shallow, it’s also not that bad and fans of Karloff will certainly enjoy it.

A nobleman (Vincent Price) is convinced his late wife (Barbara Steele) is haunting him.

_Pit and the Pendulum_ is the second, and one of the best of director Roger Corman’s series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations. This film improves on Corman’s previous Poe adaptation (<span data-imdb-id="tt0053925">_House of Usher_</span>) in almost every way.

Similar to the Hammer Film productions, Pit and the Pendulum features great sets and makes wonderful use of color. Unlike Hammer, however, Corman didn’t have a pool of great English actors to pull from. While Price and Steele are great, John Kerr is distinctly American in what should have been and Englishman’s role.

The script by Richard Matheson runs a lean 80 minutes and manages to strike just the right tone, while providing a truly memorable set piece for the finale.

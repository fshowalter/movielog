_House of Games_ is a movie about confidence games, but the film isn’t as concerned with conning the audience as much as it is with exploring the nature of people drawn to these games.

The story sees a psychiatrist, played by Lindsay Crouse becoming involved with a con man, played by Joe Mantegna.

Those who’ve seen Mamet’s later film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0120176">_The Spanish Prisoner_</span> may walk away from _House of Games_ feeling disappointed. Whereas _The Spanish Prisoner_ revolved around conning a naturally suspicious man, _House of Games_ revolves around conning a woman who, on some level, _wants_ to be taken. This distinction is important, because despite the title, _The Spanish Prisoner_ is all about the game, and _House of Games_ is all about the players.

Looked at in this light, _House of Games_ isn’t as disappointing. It’s still frustrating to see through the deceptions well before the protagonist, but Mamet does a good job of explaining why his protagonist is so blind.

As for the cast, it’s somewhat of a mixed bag. While the casting of Mamet’s then wife Crouse in the lead is questionable, Mantegna and Ricky Jay shine. Jay in particular, seems born to deliver Mamet’s signature dialog, and his part should have been larger.

A high school reunion brings Biggs, wife Hannigan and new baby back to their hometown where Biggs meets up with the old gang. The gross-out gags make the comedy hit-and-miss, but the cast is great, particularly Biggs and Sean William Scott, and the script does offer some honest observations about the realities of growing up; making this a surprisingly solid finale (one hopes) to the series.

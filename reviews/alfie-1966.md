In 1960s London, a young working-class man (Michael Caine) carelessly uses women without regard for their feelings.

_Alfie_ works, primarily, because of Michael Caine. His performance in the titular role makes the film, and it’s an ingenious trick. Watching the film, you’re appalled at the way Alfie treats everyone around him, yet you still care about him because Caine charms the film’s _audience_ the very same way Alfie charms the film’s _characters_.

The film also works because of the talent behind the camera. Screenwriter Bill Naughton does a wonderful job adapting his play, and director Lewis Gilbert does a spectacular job capturing '60s London atmosphere. Further, Gilbert avoids the “stagy” feel that dogs many theater adaptations.

_Alfie_ is a movie that gets you thinking without ever being preachy. As a character Alfie is a representation of a societal problem, one that we’ve yet to find a solution for today, and it’s that relevance, combined with Caine’s performance, that makes _Alfie_ stand up well to repeat viewings.

If _Alfie_ has a weakness, it’s Shelley Winters, who’s miscast in a very critical role. She does her best, but there’s no chemistry between her and Caine, causing the film’s finale to suffer.

_This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse_ (_Esta Noite Encarnarei no Teu Cadáver_) is a sequel-cum-remake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0059440">_At Midnight I’ll Take Your Soul_</span>. After a dynamite opening montage that sees Joe recover from the first film’s finale, he’s right back to work kidnapping women in his--now eternal--quest for a son.

Unfortunately, while writer/director/star José Mojica Marins’ clearly has a larger budget to work with this time around, he fails to bring anything new to the table outside of a hit-or-miss dream sequence involving hell. Granted, Marins still knows how to crank up the atmosphere and deliver some creepy thrills, and the Universal Monster ending is a significant improvement over the original’s poor man’s Hamlet, but, with a running time almost half-an-hour longer than the original’s, _The Night I'll Possess Your Corpse_ can’t help but feel recycled.

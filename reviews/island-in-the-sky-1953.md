After crash landing in the frozen uncharted wilds of northern Canada, a captain (John Wayne) and his crew fight to survive while other pilots lead a search party.

_Island in the Sky_ begins with a somber, Dragnet-like narration that would seem right at home in a wartime documentary. This sets the tone for the entire film and helps give the film an extra layer of realism.

Told almost exclusively from the point of view of the men involved, _Island in the Sky_ is very much a film about camaraderie among men and pilots, and the unspoken bonds that hold them together. To that end, the movie works very well.

Unfortunately director William Wellman makes one big blunder, by including a scene involving a call from one of the downed crew’s wife. We see her lying on a bed, sobbing into the phone with a newborn baby lying next to her. This whole scene is not only overplayed and drawn out, but it drags the film down to cheap melodrama and undermines the very essence of the movie.

Of course the crew’s wives and families are worried, but the movie isn’t _about_ them. It’s about the men themselves, and what it means to _them_ when one of their own goes down. It’s about _them_ and _their_ struggle to survive. This one scene shatters this whole perspective and diminishes the movie.

Given Wellman’s blunder, and the similarities in themes between _Island in the Sky_ and many of Howard Hawks’ films, I couldn’t help but wonder what this movie would have looked like under his hand. Given that he was, at the time, directing <span data-imdb-id="tt0045810">_Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_</span>, I can’t help thinking that _Island in the Sky_ would have been more up his alley.

Six strangers invited to a dinner party discover that they, along with the butler and maid, are all being blackmailed by their host, who winds up dead, meaning one of them is a murderer.

Ostensibly based on the popular Parker Brothers board game of the same name, Clue goes back to the source material to satirize the drawing room whodunits of the 1930s. Lynn's direction is uninspired, but the cast is great, especially Curry who propels the film along with an infectious maniacal intensity.

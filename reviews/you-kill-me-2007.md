An aging, alcoholic hit man from Buffalo (Ben Kingsley) gets sent to San Francisco to dry out, where he meets a woman (Tea Leoni).

_You Kill Me_ is an eccentric comedy-noir in the vein of _Fargo_ that never quite manages to find its footing. While it hits more than it misses, it still misses a lot.

The performances are excellent all around. Some might complain about the plausibility of the chemistry between Kingsley and Leoni, and if you're sensitive to that sort of thing you might have an issue, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything wrong with the always excellent Dennis Farina and Philip Baker Hall.

The only weakness in the movie is the script, which never seems to find the right balance between comedy and drama. Instead of being a great black comedy or a great drama it's merely okay, but with the caliber of talent in front of the camera, that's a let down.

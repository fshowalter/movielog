A young English woman (Jean Simmons) in Paris wakes up to find her brother (and his entire hotel room!) missing.

_So Long at the Fair_ is built around a premise worthy of Hitchcock. Indeed, he made a film twelve years prior built around a similar theme (person vanishes and nobody acknowledges them as even having existed) with <span data-imdb-id="tt0030341">_The Lady Vanishes_</span>.

Unfortunately, _So Long at the Fair_ lacks Hitchcock’s flair and suffers for it. Jean Simmons comes across as a whiny brat for much of the movie, and spends more time crying than she does looking for her brother.

Indeed, the movie only really picks up when Dirk Bogarde takes over. While the script doesn’t give any reason for his sudden interest in Simmons’ character, you really don’t care because by that point you’re sick of her.

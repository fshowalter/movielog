John Ford's first talkie is a espionage adventure shackled with the worst dialog I've heard in a Ford film. Loy--carrying over her typcasting from silents as a an exotic vamp--gets the worst of it, with her lines full of inexplicable "thees' and "thous" delivered with her eyes half closed. For his part, Ford's heart seems to be in the bookend story of the titlar regiment heading to World War I France, not the Kipling-esque yarn involving crystal balls and femme fatales.

A quiet accountant (Johnny Depp) is transformed into a feared outlaw.

_Dead Man_ is not for everyone. Some will certainly be put-off by writer-director Jim Jarmusch's off-beat approach, but others will find the movie original and interesting enough to look past its shortcomings.

Johnny Depp delivers another brilliant performance, this time as a man who transforms over the course of his gradual death. His performance is measured and restrained, which is perfect against the over-the-top characters he encounters.

Jarmusch weaves an existentialist theme throughout the story that serves to give the movie substance, but avoids pretentiousness by serving up a good bit of black comedy. It could be argued whether his characters are symbols or visions, but there's no denying their originality.

Still, as I mentioned earlier, _Dead Man_ does have its shortcomings. First is the running time of 121 minutes, which is 15-20 minutes too long. The movie--like the main character--runs out of steam toward the end. Second is Neil Young's score. While at times it's absolutely brilliant, at others it's intrusive and could stand to be a bit more restrained. Both of these faults are really technicalities and part of Jarmusch's growing process as a filmmaker, and should not detract from the wonderfully original vision he's created.

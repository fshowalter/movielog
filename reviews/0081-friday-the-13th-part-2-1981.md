Still no hockey mask, but we're firmly in slasher territory as Jason, sporting a burlap sack for a mask, stalks a group of camp counselors.

This entry's grown on me. It lacks the <span data-imdb-id="tt0080761">first film</span>'s dingy atmosphere and documentary style, but the supporting cast proves more memorable and the script provides the final-girl with real agency. Even with sack-head Jason's comical look, compared to the first entry, this one proves a tad superior.

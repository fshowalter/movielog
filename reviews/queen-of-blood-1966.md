_Queen Of Blood_ is a bad movie.

In all honesty the only thing that kept my finger off the fast-forward was the hope that it would somehow get better. After all, it's got a good premise:

An alien spaceship crashes on Mars and a team of astronauts are sent out to investigate. The team finds an alien specimen and proceeds take it back to earth, but while en-route they are killed one-by-one by their new passenger.

But wait-doesn't this sound a little familiar? Despite its poor quality, this film obviously influenced Dan O'Bannon, writer of <span data-imdb-id="tt0078748">_Alien_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0089489">_Lifeforce_</span>, and <span data-imdb-id="tt0100802">_Total Recall_</a>, as all of those films have images or themes that seem to show up here.</p>

But unlike those movies, this one is bad. It's slow, stiffly acted, and underproduced.

And yet it's littered with surprising bits of logic in it's dealings with space travel.. and did I mention it's got John Saxon, Dennis Hopper and a 74 year old Basil Rathbone?

So frustrating. Like most Corman shlock this is a mixed bag that hints at greater things but leaves you feeling burned.

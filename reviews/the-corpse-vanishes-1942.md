A reporter tracks a scientist (Bela Lugosi) who, aided by his dwarf henchman, kidnaps and murders virgin brides to keep his aging wife alive and young.

_The Corpse Vanishes_ opens with atmosphere to spare courtesy a great early shot of a star Bela Lugosi leering out of the back of a darkened hearse. It's a great visual, and it's easy to imagine this scene inspiring Don Coscarelli's <span data-imdb-id="tt0079714">_Phantasm_</span>, which portends good things for the film to follow.

Unfortunately, these hopes turn out to be totally unfounded, as the film is quickly dragged down by wooden acting and a plot that's both recycled and yet, at times, incomprehensible.

After the solid opening, the film quickly devolves to a quasi-remake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0031851">_The Return of Doctor X_</span>. There's lots of extraneous filler, such as Lugosi's dwarf sidekick, and the fact that Lugosi's character and his wife sleep in coffins, but it's essentially the same tired story of a mad scientist undone by his own arrogance thanks to a nosy reporter (Luana Walters this time).

Unfortunately, _The Corpse Vanishes_ doesn't have the luxury of a train-wreck performance by Humphrey Bogart to keep you glued to the screen, so even the brief 64-minute running time is something of a chore, making this one worth it for die-hard Lugosi fans only.

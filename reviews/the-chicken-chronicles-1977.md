A high school senior (Steve Guttenburg) comes of age in the late 1960s while working a chicken stand.

Ever wonder how Steve Guttenburg became a semi-star during the 1980s? _The Chicken Chronicles_. At only 19 years of age he not only carries the entire movie, but does it with ease.

The script manages to rise above the typical teen sex comedy, injecting an undercurrent of angst set against the Vietnam War.

Director Frank Simon doesn't do anything flashy, but does eschew overt nostalgia, allowing the story to stand on its own merits.

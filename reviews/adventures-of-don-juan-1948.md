Famed lady's man Don Juan (Errol Flynn) returns to his native Spain and fights against corruption and betrayal.

Watching this movie, you can't help but be reminded of an earlier Errol Flynn film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0029843">_The Adventures of Robin Hood_</a>. Indeed, take away that film's strong supporting cast and talented director and you've got this movie.

Errol Flynn can only do so much and, while he's a joy to watch as Don Juan, whenever he's not on the screen the movie grinds to a halt. Thankfully though, Flynn is on the screen most of the time which, combined with some excellent fencing sequences, makes this watchable.

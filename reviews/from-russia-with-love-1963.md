A shadowy organization uses a Russian spy (Daniela Bianchi) and a top-secret decoder machine to lure British secret agent James Bond (Sean Connery) to his death.

_From Russia with Love_ is the second entry in the long-running James Bond series, following <span data-imdb-id="tt0055928">_Dr. No_</span>, and the first to feature a theme song, though one not played over the opening credits. This time around, the story is less adventure, no plots involving island bases, nuclear radiation, and space programs, but rather a simple espionage thriller involving a misled Russian agent and cold-war paranoia.

But while the plot lacks camp, we do have the first instance of the famous Bond gadgets, as well as Desmond Llewelyn's first appearance as the classic, deadpan Q, although here he's referred to as Major Boothroyd. Further, you've got a villainess in Lotte Lenya who would provide the inspiration for the Austin Powers character Frau Farbissina.

This entry works at a slower pace than _Dr. No_, but it's still engaging. Think less comic book adventure and more standard spy thriller. Daniela Bianchi is one of the best leading ladies of the Bond series and Pedro Armendáriz goes down as the best of Bond's local sidekicks. Sadly, Armendáriz, suffering from cancer during filming, took his own life one month after his scenes were completed.

_From Russia with Love_ likely won't sit as well with Bond fans who enjoy the big adventure and campy accoutrements, but for the rest it's an easy recommendation thanks to the tight story, great performances, and solid thrills.

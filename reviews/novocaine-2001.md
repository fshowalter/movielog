_Novocaine_ is a fairly average black comedy/mystery that's bolstered by a somewhat original script and outstanding performances from it's cast.

The only real weakness is in the direction, which doesn't feel at all original or inspired. So instead of a classic we're left with a very entertaining popcorn movie that's still better than most of what makes it to theaters these days.

In the hands of a more capable director this could have been truly great, but even so you won't feel burned.

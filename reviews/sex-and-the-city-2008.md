A New York author (Sara Jessica Parker) and her three friends (Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon) experience highs and lows of the course of a year in their search for love and happiness.

_Sex and the City_ is like consumer porn for women. From the gowns, to the dresses, the handbags, even the furniture, the whole film is built around a fantasy lifestyle none but the richest of women could hope to afford. To that end, the film can be alienating for men, because, lets face it, we don't know a five-dollar bag from a five-thousand-dollar one and, more importantly, we don't care.

That said, the film isn't bad. It's accessible to those who've never watched the series, and has some good laughs. Granted, most of the plot is pretty predictable, but Kim Cattrall's character's arc, which unfortunately doesn't come until the film's final quarter, is a breath of fresh air.

Unfortunately, _Sex and the City_ feels more like an anthology then a single story, and at nearly two and half hours long, you wonder if it's ever going to end. There simply isn't enough emotional depth here to sustain such a long running time. This is a glossy fantasy masquerading as something deeper, and while the series may have been able to maintain the fa√ßade for 30-minute episodes, at this length, it wears thin.

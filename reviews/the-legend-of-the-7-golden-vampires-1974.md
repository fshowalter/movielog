Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) travels to a remote Chinese village to help a group of brothers defeat a group of vampires.

_The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula_ is actually the US cut of _The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires_. However, the movie was so heavily edited, it really must be reviewed on its own.

Running a brief 72 minutes versus the original cut's 89, _The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula_ maximizes the exploitation aspects, and downplays everything else. Whole sections of dialog are pared down or cut completely, while one scene involving the vampires marauding through a village and stripping a young girl is repeated 3 times, once with the image reversed!

The result, as you can imagine, is a movie that is practically incomprehensible, and would be completely unwatchable if it weren't for the presence of Peter Cushing. Even with his dialog cut, Cushing's undeniable charisma makes this mess bearable, but only just.

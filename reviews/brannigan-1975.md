A Chicago police detective (John Wayne) travels to London to extradite a mobster (John Vernon).

_Brannigan_ is a fairly routine, but nonetheless fun, 70s cop flick notable chiefly as one of the few "modern" films of star John Wayne's later career.

This film, along with Wayne's previous outing, <span data-imdb-id="tt0071824">_McQ_</span>, were made after Wayne realized his folly in turning down the lead in the wildly successful <span data-imdb-id="tt0066999">_Dirty Harry_</span>, and, as such, both are really _Dirty Harry_ clones featuring Wayne dishing out his brand of justice while dealing with an uptight bureaucracy.

It's a good fit for the Duke and he seems to take the role with just the right amount of salt, delivering most of his lines with a half-grin and a wink toward the audience.

The only problem is that the Duke looks tired. At 67 years old, Wayne's age was catching up with him in a big way, and he seems haggard and perpetually short of breath throughout the film. While this look may have served him in a more serious picture, it doesn't work in a popcorn action flick like this where Wayne looks like an old man playing a young man's game.

Still, fans of the Duke will likely enjoy it, but others would do well to check out the real _Dirty Harry_ instead.

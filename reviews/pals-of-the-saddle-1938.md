synopsis: In this Three Mesquiteers entry, John Wayne fakes his death to go undercover and foil a poison gas smuggling plot.

---

_Pals of the Saddle_ marks a crossroads. John Wayne steps into the _Three Mesquiteers_ series, less than a year before <span data-imdb-id="tt0031971">_Stagecoach_</span> would make him a star. The film itself? Caught between dusty horse opera and the modern world's anxieties about war.

The plot finds Wayne's Stony Brooke framed for murder by a mysterious woman played by Doreen McKay, leading him to stage his own death and go undercover to expose a conspiracy involving poison gas shipments. It's a decidedly modern concern wrapped in Western trappings. This strange alchemy doesn't quite produce gold, but it offers something more interesting than the typical B-Western fare.

Wayne, stepping into the role previously inhabited by Robert Livingston, elevates every scene he's in. Even in this modest programmer, there's something magnetic about his performance. He moves with that unmistakable swagger, ducking through doorways, and delivers his dialogue with his trademark laconic drawl. When he adopts the disguise of a crusty prospector (complete with unconvincing black beard stubble), we glimpse the playful side that would serve him well in later, better films. 

The other two Mesquiteers? Dead weight. Ray "Crash" Corrigan bumbles through scenes with maddening incompetence. Max Terhune rides with a ventriloquist dummy--yes, a dummy--and the gimmick wears thin fast. Director George Sherman knows it, keeping Wayne front and center while the others vanish for long stretches.

This improves the film but exposes the franchise's fundamental flaw. Why burden Wayne with partners when he can carry the story alone?

Still, _Pals of the Saddle_ has its moments. The burning stage finale delivers genuine thrills. The poison gas subplot, however clumsy, gives the proceedings weight that cattle rustling never could. It's a B-Western trying to find relevance in a changing world.

The film matters more for what it represents than what it achieves. It's a stepping stone in Wayne's journey, a genre grappling with contemporary fears, a franchise entry that accidentally proves less is more. For Wayne completists, it's essential. For everyone else, it's a mildly diverting hour elevated by a star-in-the-making doing his best with second-rate material.

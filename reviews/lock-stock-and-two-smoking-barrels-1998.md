Four friends (Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, and Jason Statham) find themselves indebted to a London gangster with only a week to come up with half a million pounds.

_Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ has aged well. Director Guy Ritchie's slick visual style was so overwhelming in 1998, that it obscured the script's ample wit and humor. Ten years and countless imitations later, the film gels together as a more even whole, no longer dominated by the editing and camera work.

Some of this newfound appreciation may also come from the inspired casting of Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, both of whom made their film debuts here. Jones in particular is a casting coup, and Ritchie's decision to give him the best line in the film is well rewarded. And let's not forget Ritchie's other casting triumph, making Sting believable as a hard-ass, tough-as-nails London pub owner. _That_ is damn near amazing.

Granted, the film's not perfect. While much of the cast shines, others seem to fade to the background. This, combined with the sheer number of pivotal characters, means some end up lost in the plot's relentless shuffle. It's a problem that lessens on repeat viewings, but it's a problem nonetheless.

Ultimately, _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ is a must-see for fans of British gangster pictures, and possibly, for fans of Quentin Tarantino's work as well, though Ritchie is clearly more enamored with <span data-imdb-id="tt0081070">_The Long Good Friday_</span> than <span data-imdb-id="tt0049406">_The Killing_</span>.

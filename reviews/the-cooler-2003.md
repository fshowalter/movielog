A man (William H. Macy) whose luck is so bad, a casino manager (Alec Baldwin) employs him to "cool" winning gamblers, finds his fortunes beginning to change when he falls in love with a woman (Maria Bello).

_The Cooler_, in different hands, could have been a slapstick comedy exploiting the disastrous results of William H. Macy's lead character in various physical comedy gags, while scheming boss Alec Baldwin maniacally attempts to profit until virginal Maria Bello comes along to show Macy's character that we make our own luck.

Thankfully, the film is nothing like this.

That's not to say the film is devoid of humor. It's actually quite funny at times, but it's a humor tinged with sadness. The script by director Wayne Kramer and Frank Hannah is a thoughtful mediation on life, love, and change.

Particularly change, as on one level the film works as a commentary on Vegas itself and the change from the old guard, gambling-based view to the new corporate mega-resorts that dominate the strip.

All feel lived in and real. Macy conveys a lifetime of disappointments in a single look. Bello's body language belies a guarded front that hides her feelings, and Alec Baldwin quietly rages as his world crumbles around him. The film's theme of change is evident in each of them, but in a subtle, believable manner.

While _The Cooler_ will certainly resonate with some more than others, it's a good film that's worth checking out. Vegas fans will appreciate the atmosphere, and the nods toward the town's colorful past, while fans of Macy, Bello and Baldwin will certainly enjoy their respective turns. And those that don't currently fall into either group may well find themselves members after watching.

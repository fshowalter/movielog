Two showgirls (Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe) look for eligible bachelors on a transatlantic cruise to Paris.

_Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ is a light, breezy musical comedy from director Howard Hawks that basically serves as a showcase for its two leads, Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. While someone like Billy Wilder might have been able to give the film a bit more depth, Hawks' brisk pacing makes it immensely watchable despite its lack of substance.

Though she only gets second billing, _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ is really Marilyn Monroe's picture and she shines. From her famous "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" musical number to her numerous scene-stealing lines ("I want to marry him for _your_ money!"), Monroe turns in a performance that would cement her iconic, sex-symbol status.

The film's biggest problem is that there's simply not much to it. The story is paper-thin and lacks any real emotional investment. Further, there's very little chemistry between Elliott Reid and Jane Russell, which undoes that entire aspect of the story. Were it not for Monroe, the film would be a waste.

That said, for fans of Monroe, _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ is a must-see, and for others there are certainly worse ways to spend 91 minutes.

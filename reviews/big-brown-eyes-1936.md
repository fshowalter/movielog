A detective (Cary Grant) teams with his manicurist-turned-reporter girlfriend to solve a case involving stolen jewels.

_Big Brown Eyes_ is notable for two things. One, someone shoots a baby. You don’t often see that in movies, let alone in 1936. Two, Cary Grant is totally forgettable. I’m still trying to put my finger on exactly how a movie manages to bury Cary Grant, but _Big Brown Eyes_ pulls it off. Maybe it’s the really bad ventriloquist tricks he pulls, maybe it’s his lack of screen time, or maybe Grant hadn’t quite figured out how to carry a movie yet. Whatever the cause, the movie suffers for it.

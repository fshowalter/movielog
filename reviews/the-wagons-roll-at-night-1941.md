Bogart plays a once-big circus promoter reduced to playing small rural towns. He thinks he’s caught a break when he discovers a naive store clerk with a knack for lion taming played by Albert. Bogart makes Albert a star, and the circus plays to bigger and bigger crowds, but along the way Albert falls for Bogart’s sister, which–unknown to Albert–leads Bogart to try and sabotage Albert’s act.

This <span data-imdb-id="tt0029080">_Kid Galad_</span> remake misses Bette Davis but compensates with Albert who, despite being too old for the role, plays far more likable than Wayne Morris. It's also eighteen minutes shorter—in part because they gave Bogart's _Galahad_ role to a lion.

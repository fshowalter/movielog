A constable's daughter (Nova Pilbeam) aids a man (Derrick De Marney) who's on the run after being convicted of murdering an actress.

_Young and Innocent_ (_The Girl Was Young_ in the USA) is an enjoyable early thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock. Incorporating many of the famed director's favorite themes such as mistaken identity, man on the run, and fear of police, the script by frequent collaborator Charles Bennett packs a good amount of plot into 80 brisk minutes, and stars Nova Pilbeam (who played the young daughter in Hitchcock's earlier <span data-imdb-id="tt0025452">_The Man Who Knew Too Much_</span>) and Derrick De Marney carry the film well.

The only problem with _Young and Innocent_ is that the actual story is pretty flimsy. The plot is strung together on a series of coincidences that don't hold up to much afterthought, but it's a testament to the cast and director that the film works in spite of this shortcoming. Indeed the finale is a masterpiece, with a memorable tracking shot that's vintage Hitchcock.

While it may rank below his earlier <span data-imdb-id="tt0026029">_The 39 Steps_</span>, and his follow-up, <span data-imdb-id="tt0030341">_The Lady Vanishes_</span>, _Young and Innocent_ nonetheless stands as one of Hitchcock's best pre-Hollywood films, and one who's premise he revisited thirteen years later with <span data-imdb-id="tt0042994">_Stage Fright_</span>.

A washed up movie star (Sam Shepard) flees the set of his latest production.

_Don’t Come Knocking_ is a beautifully photographed film that has one fatal flaw: the script doesn’t provide anyone for the viewer to care about.

The main character, a washed up action star who’s life and career have been on a downward spiral for some time, is so far removed from anything outside of Hollywood that he’s totally un-relatable to the average viewer.

As a result, there’s no emotional investment, which causes the film to drag as you wait for something to happen.

There are a few bright spots. Eva Marie Saint is great in a part that should have been bigger, and the cinematography and direction are top-notch, but none of this can overcome the fatal script.

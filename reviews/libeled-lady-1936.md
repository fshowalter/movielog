A newspaper editor (Spencer Tracy) convinces his fianc√©e (Jean Harlow) to marry another man (William Powell) as part of a scheme to trap an heiress (Myrna Loy) who's suing the paper for libel.

_Libeled Lady_ is an enjoyable romantic comedy thanks to a great cast and a smart script.

Despite receiving top billing, Jean Harlow is actually the weak link in this all-star cast. She's not bad, but, despite being in a real-life relationship with co-star William Powell, lacks the on-screen chemistry present between him and Myrna Loy. That, combined with the script's giving Spencer Tracy the most colorful part, leaves Harlow with little to do aside from whine and look glamorous, which she does.

The clever script manages to be funny without relying on inane screwball antics, something of a rarity in 1930s comedies. Here, the humor is derived from the situations, rather than simply having one of the female leads act like a self-absorbed idiot. It's a refreshing change and proof that physical comedy can work if done right, such as the scene where Powell pretends to be an ace angler. All this is capped off by some whip-smart dialog performed by a cast that genuinely seems to be having fun with their parts.

If you're a fan of the stars, _Libeled Lady_ is a must see, though I doubt anyone could be completely put off by it.

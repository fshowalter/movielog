Underachieving cops Hill and Tatum get reassigned to an undercover unit where they're tasked with uncovering a drug ring at a local high school. The script by Bacall and Hill avoids tired spoof bits and easy gross-out gags, opting instead for a more subversive mix of social and genre satire that should hold up well to repeat viewings. Toss in a strong supporting cast and you've got a movie that's funnier than it has any right to be.

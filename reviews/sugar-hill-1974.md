After gangsters murder her boyfriend, a woman recruits an army of zombies in her quest for revenge.

_Sugar Hill_ is a travesty. Instead of delivering what should have been a sure-fire classic, writer Tim Kelly and director Paul Maslansky turn in a barely passable horror film lacking any real fun.

The premise is so brilliant it's scary. It's like somebody was watching Jack Hill's <span data-imdb-id="tt0069897">_Coffy_</span> and thought, "Hmmn... yeah it's got Pam Grier going on a rampage beating up pimps, The Man, crazy white bitches and Sid Haig, but what it really needs is zombies!"

And that someone was right.

Unfortunately, whereas _Coffy_ was an R-rated picture, _Sugar Hill_ went for a PG rating which, for a film that revolves around killing a bunch of people with a horde of zombies, is pretty restricting. Where's the over-the-top gore? The gratuitous nudity? The visceral violence? Where's the _fun_?

When you're making a zombie revenge picture you're not shooting for Academy Awards, you're aiming for cheap thrills, and _Sugar Hill_ has none, which is a real shame since the ingredients are there. Marki Bey is no Pam Grier, but she works, Robert Quarry is great as The Man, and Don Pedro Colley has a lot of potential as Baron Samedi. If only the film delivered on its premise.

A ruthless mortician stops at nothing in his quest for a woman to carry on his bloodline.

_At Midnight I’ll Take Your Soul_ (_À Meia-Noite Levarei Sua Alma_) is a fairly entertaining Brazilian horror picture that, for the most part, belies its shoestring budget. Director-star José Mojica Marins does a lot with a little, cranking up the atmosphere and using some fairly graphic violence to punctuate his scenes and develop his “Coffin Joe” character.

And speaking of Coffin Joe, Marins does a great job with him, painting him as both a monster and a humanist, and playing him just over the top enough to be larger than life, but not so much that he loses his edge.

Unfortunately, _At Midnight I’ll Take Your Soul_ isn’t perfect. The script gets a little verbose toward the end, with Coffin Joe delivering a soliloquy that would be more at home in a poor man’s Hamlet, and some of the special effects at the end betray the film’s small budget.

That said, horror fans should enjoy it, but others should probably pass.

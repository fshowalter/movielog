Donen channels Hitchcock and Wilder in this deft blend of mystery, thriller and romance with Grant, Matthau, and others pursuing Hepburn, believing she knows the location of a fortune her recently deceased husband stole during World War II.

Grant and Hepburn are great together (making you wish all the more that Grant hadn't turned down Billy Wilder's <span data-imdb-id="tt0050658">_Love in the Afternoon_</span> thinking himself too old to play opposite Hepburn) and the supporting cast, including James Coburn and George Kennedy is top notch. Sure, the Jean-Louis kid is poorly written, but that's a very minor blemish.

With the world overrun by zombies, a group of scientists and soldiers begin to come unhinged in an underground Florida bunker.

_Day of the Dead_ is the weakest of writer/director George A. Romero’s original zombie trilogy. While Tom Savini’s special effects are as disturbing as ever, atrocious acting and a poor script drag down a viable premise.

While the original <span data-imdb-id="">_Night of the Living Dead_</span> dealt with racial tension, and it’s sequel, <span data-imdb-id="">_Dawn of the Dead_</span>, dealt with consumerism, _Day of the Dead_ attempts to focus on the nature of civilization, and what exactly is necessary for a being to be considered civilized.

Unfortunately, Romero’s script never quite manages to deliver on this premise. Instead, we’re left with some awful dialog and a story that brings nothing new to the table.

Further, Romero seems to have forgotten how the strength of his previous entries lied in their relatable characters, as the characters in _Day of the Dead_ are little more than cookie-cutter stereotypes pulled from bad movies: the paranoid military captain, the borderline insane doctor, even the tough-as-nails heroine with the heart of gold. There’s nothing _real_ here. And, of course, it doesn’t help that, with the exception of Jarlath Conroy, the cast is completely devoid of any charisma.

Still, fans of Savini’s work won’t be disappointed, as the film’s ravenous zombies chomp and tear apart (an effect that packed a lot more punch in the previous _Dawn of the Dead_) an ample supply of foolhardy victims.

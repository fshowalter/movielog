An insurance investigator (Jack Hawkins) finds himself caught up with an old flame and the target of blackmail after uncovering an art forgery scam.

_Fortune Is a Woman_ (_She Played with Fire_ in the USA) is a solid British mystery/thriller buoyed by a charismatic performance from lead Jack Hawkins.

Hawkins seems tailor made for the role of Oliver Branwell, a studious, but ultimately human insurance investigator caught up in a plot that's always just a bit beyond his grasp. Part of Hawkins' charm is that the character isn't stupid, he figures things out as quickly and keeps the plot moving, but the script, by director Sidney Gilliat from the Winston Graham novel, is always one-step ahead. Hawkins even manages, somehow, to make the usually fatal voice-over narration work.

The supporting cast is all solid. Arlene Dahl is a little shaky early, but soon rights herself as Hawkins' love interest. Christopher Lee even turns up in a small, but fun role as a high-strung actor.

Indeed, though _Fortune Is a Woman_ may not be the greatest of mysteries, it's hard not to like. The crisp black and white photography, including several stylish shots, only highlights a solid story performed by a good cast. For fans of the genre, what more could you ask for?

Let's get this out of the way first: this film is not directed by James Cameron. It's not written by James Cameron. James Cameron had virtually nothing to do with it.

That said, and aside from some ill-written dialog, the only thing wrong with this movie is the score. Brad Fiedel's music is as much a part of the Terminator mythos as Arnold and should have been brought back.

Score aside, the movie is an enjoyable experience that feels more like an homage to the previous films than a sequel to them, which isn't a bad thing at all.

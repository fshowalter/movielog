Backwoods siblings Calhoun and Parsons abduct tourists and bury them in a hidden garden before slaughtering them for meat for Calhoun's popular beef jerky and sausage.

Calhoun's great and the finale's a hoot, but this would-be satire of rural horror films like <span data-imdb-id="tt0072271">_The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_</span> isn't anywhere near as funny or scary as it needs to be.

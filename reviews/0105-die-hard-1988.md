"It will blow you through the back wall of the theater!" Does anyone remember that tagline? It makes no sense, yet it's my go-to description for folks that haven't seen _Die Hard_.

It's difficult to understate the film's cultural impact.

The plot--NYC cop Willis finds himself in the wrong place at the right time to foil a group of armed assialants in a Los Angeles highrise--birthed the "fly-in-the-ointment" genre. Films like Under Seige, Air Force One, Cliffhanger, and countless others copied the formula with varying success.

Alan Rickman's performance beget the "suave European villian" trope that dominated action films for the next decade. One could even argue there's a through-line between his charismatic but icey portrayal and Anthony Hopkin's award-winning turn as Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs.

Garbo plays a Russian official sent to Paris to negotiate the sale of some jewels, only to find herself falling for Douglas, a lawyer representing an exiled Duchess contesting Russia's ownership of the jewels.

Garbo's passable in her first American comedy, but the film's at its best early, before she even shows up, with the three Russian envoys falling victim to the capitalist trappings of Paris. Fourth-billed Lugosi only shows up for a five minute scene towards the film's finale.

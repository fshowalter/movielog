A look at several interconnected lives in Dublin.

_Intermission_ probably wouldn't have gotten a US theatrical release without the presence of Colin Farrell. That's not to say it's a bad movie, just that it's neither unique nor entertaining enough to hold it's own without a little star power.

The filmmakers borrow quite heavily from Danny Boyle, Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, and while Intermission does feel like an imitation, it's one of the highest quality. The movie's real strength is Colin Farrell, who even in a supporting role commands attention every second that he's on-screen, right from the film's opening scene (which easily the movie's high point) onward. The rest of the cast is buoyed by Farrell's performance, especially Colm Meaney, who's subplot with Farrell is the strongest in the movie.

On the down-side, some of the sub-plots aren't fully resolved, and at least one loose end (the rock throwing kid) is left dangling, but neither of these minor flaws should leave you feeling burned.

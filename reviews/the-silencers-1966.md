Martin plays Matt Helm, a semi-retired agent of ICE (Intelligence and Counter Espionage) coaxed back to active duty in order to stop an atomic plot by BIG O (Brotherhood of International Government and Order).

Martin's great and takes the material with the right amount of salt, but opposite him, Stevens tries too hard with the slapstick, dragging down what should have been an easy hundred minutes.

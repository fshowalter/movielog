During World War II, a construction boss (John Wayne) working for the Navy in the Pacific, clashes with an officer (Dennis O’Keefe) over arming his workers against the Japanese.

While it’s primarily a war-drama, _The Fighting Seabees_ has a little bit of everything: action, comedy, even John Wayne dancing the Jitterbug --though one look Wayne’s dance moves provides ample reason why they were never filmed again.

The script by Borden Chase seems tailor made for Wayne, right down to his character’s name: Wedge Donovan, a John Wayne name if ever there was one. The rest of the cast is pretty flat though, especially romantic lead Susan Hayward who has no chemistry with either Wayne or his supposed rival Dennis O’Keefe. Still, Wayne manages to carry the film, easily overcoming the cast’s shortcomings with his charisma and presence.

For his part, director Edward Ludwig turns in some surprisingly realistic battle sequences. Though not gory, the heavy casualties inflicted on both sides heighten the tension as seemingly any character could fall prey to a random bullet or well placed mortar. Had Ludgwig trimmed more of the fat, such as the aforementioned dancing, or the propaganda-infused fight song, _The Fighting Seabees_ would have been much better.

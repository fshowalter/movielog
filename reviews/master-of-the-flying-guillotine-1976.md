A blind warrior disguises himself as a monk and goes in search of the one-armed boxer who killed his apprentices.

_Master of the Flying Guillotine_, also known as _The One Armed Boxer vs. the Flying Guillotine_ and _One Armed Boxer II_, is not about plot. Sure, there's some loose narration about the government trying to subvert supporters of the Ming dynasty, but it's nothing more than a device to setup fight scenes. Thankfully, _Master of the Flying Guillotine_'s fight scenes are more than good enough to make you overlook this.

Featuring a wide variety of weapons and fighting styles (including an Indian who may have inspired the creators of the _Street Fighter_ video games), the battles are fierce and bloody. The flying guillotine itself is somewhat silly looking, but impressive enough when used, and adds a welcome bit of originality.

Writer, director, and star Jimmy Wang Yu demonstrates a great deal of charisma and a flair for shooting the fight scenes as a director.

A blind warrior disguises himself as a monk and goes in search of the one-armed boxer who killed his apprentices.

_Master of the Flying Guillotine_, also known as _The One Armed Boxer vs. the Flying Guillotine_ and _One Armed Boxer II_, is not about plot. Sure, there's some loose narration about the government trying to subvert supporters of the Ming dynasty, but it's nothing more than an device to setup fight scenes. Thankfully, _Master of the Flying Guillotine_'s fight scenes are more than good enough to make you overlook this.

Featuring a wide variety of weapons and fighting styles (including an Indian who may have inspired the creators of the _Street Fighter_ video games), the battles are fierce and bloody. The flying guillotine itself is somewhat silly looking, but impressive enough when used, and adds a welcome bit of originality.

Writer, director, and star Jimmy Wang Yu demonstrates a great deal of charisma and a flair for shooting the fight scenes as a director.

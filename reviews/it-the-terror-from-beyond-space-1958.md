An alien creature stows away on a space ship and begins picking off crew members one by one.

_It! The Terror From Beyond Space_ is pretty good as far as 50s sci-fi goes. The plot moves along at a brisk pace, and the acting is about as good as you're going to get in B-movie fare.

The movie's biggest weakness is its creature effects. The creature is obviously nothing more than a man in a rubber suit, and when you finally see it, the movie loses a lot of steam. This is as much a testament to the great atmosphere and tension director Edward L. Cahn creates without showing the monster, as it is a condemnation of the shoddy effects.

The only other real weakness lies in the set design. While _It! The Terror From Beyond Space_ would be acknowledged as an inspiration for <span data-imdb-id="tt0078748">_Alien_</span>, the creators of that film dramatically increased the tension and suspense by simply shrinking the sets. _It! The Terror From Beyond Space_'s sets are huge compared to _Alien_'s tight corridors and small rooms.

Still, while not perfect, this is easily one of the best 50s sci-fi pictures and pretty entertaining.

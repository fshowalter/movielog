In case you've ever wondered what would happen if you took a Greek tragedy, adapted it for popular comics, then somehow made the pictures move, you need look no further than _Hulk_.

While the film is technically polished and well acted all around, director Ang Lee seems reluctant to let the film be _fun_. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but combined with a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes, it definitely hurts the film's commercial appeal, especially after the superior <span data-imdb-id="tt0145487">_Spider-Man_</span> proved a super-hero film can work as both a moral drama and a thrill ride.

Thus the film proves representative of it's protagonist--trying to contain a much more explosive personality beneath a somber one. Both become something special when they let go.

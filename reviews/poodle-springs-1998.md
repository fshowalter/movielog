Newly married private investigator Philip Marlowe finds corruption, blackmail, and murder in his new home of Poodle Springs.

_Poodle Springs_ is an <abbr title="Home Box Office">HBO</abbr> production, though you wouldn't know it from production values, which are top notch with lots of attention to detail. You would know it, however, from the script and the presence of James Caan in the lead role of Philip Marlowe. The script includes none of the witty dialogue Marlowe is famous for, and the mystery's premise is ridiculous to the point of satire. James Caan plays the same character he's been playing for the last decade, and lacks any of Marlowe's wit or charm.

Bob Rafelson's direction is adequate, and he does the best he can with such a poor script. The same can be said for the supporting cast's performances. The only real standout here is Sam Vlahos, who steals all his scenes as a tired gun-for-hire.

In the future, a man begins to question the values behind the Utopian society his lives in; where life ends at 30.

_Logan's Run_ is a bit too ambitious for it's own good. The film aspires to great heights, but is brought down by some poor special effects and an inability to transcend it's own time.

The core issue behind Logan's Run is the human experience, and how the removal of all things negative ultimately deprive us of our own humanity. The movie does succeed in making this point, but not in the most efficient or elegant manner. Throughout the film there are instances of multiple scenes that make same statement, when a single scene would have been more efficient and powerful. This redundancy causes the film to drag, particularly in the second act.

The films effects range from acceptable to poor, and only serve to hurt the story. _Logan's Run_ is about man's humanity, and doesn't require big flashy effects or explosions to tell it's story, and the repeated attempts to incorporate them only distract the viewer from the real message. Ditto the movie's inability to transcend it's own time. _Logan's Run_ looks and feels very much like a 1970s movie, and for a story that can transcend time, this is only a detriment.

On the plus side, Michael York is very good as Logan 5, and some of the cinematography is quite good. With better (or less) special effects and some editing, this could easily have been a B-B+ movie.

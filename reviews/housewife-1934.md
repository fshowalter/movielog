A housewife (Ann Dvorak) watches her ad-man husband (George Brent) fall for his copywriter (Bette Davis).

_Housewife_ is a pretty forgettable melodrama aside from Bette Davis' charming performance as "the other woman" and a laughably bad third act plot twist.

The film starts with a blatently staged shot that's supposed to pass for nice neighborhood street, but clearly, looks like a Hollywood set. Cut to Ann Dvorak, ever the dutiful housewife readying breakfast for her husband, played by George Brent, and son. While there isn't much chemistry between her and Brent, they're believable as a married couple struggling to make ends meet.

Things drag for a bit until Bette Davis makes her appearance, but once she does, the film takes off. Davis and Brent have chemistry to spare (they had a long running off-screen affair) and their passion gives the film a much needed boost. Things continue along in a solid, if predictable, manner with Brent's affair threatening to sink his career until he finally confronts Dvorak to ask for a divorce.

The interesting thing, watching the film now, is that Brent doesn't come across that bad. Sure, he's fooling around, but he genuinely seems to love Davis and its clear the passion is long gone between him and Dvorak.

Then comes the aforementioned "plot twist" that you'll likely see coming as soon as the scene starts. It's so far out of left field that you can't help but laugh, which is a good thing, because the movie's all downhill from here, but you're too busy laughing to notice the bad taste in your mouth.

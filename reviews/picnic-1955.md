A drifter's (William Holden) presence at a Labor Day picnic tips the emotional balance of several members of a small Kansas town.

_Picnic_ is a surprisingly effective melodrama, thanks largely to a resonant script and universally strong performances.

The script by Daniel Taradash from William Inge's play works because it feels honest. This isn't the whitewashed 1950's we're used to seeing, but a real, relatable small-town populated by real people with prejudices, hopes, dreams, and passions. Despite being half a century old, Inge's play could be staged today with a few minor changes and still work, a testament to his focus and insights on the timeless aspects of human nature.

Acting out the script is a very talented cast starting with lead William Holden. Though you could argue that he was too old for the part, nobody does the cynical, jaded everyman better than Holden. Opposite him, a very young Kim Novak is good as his love interest, as is Cliff Robertson as his college buddy.

But as good as Holden and company are, Rosalind Russell outdoes them all with her performance as a desperate and bitter schoolmarm. It's a gut wrenching and relentlessly effective turn that's sometimes painful to watch but always gripping and one that would have won Russell an Oscar had she allowed herself to be nominated. Russell, however, refused the "Supporting Actress" designation, fearing she would no longer be offered leads once producers saw her as a supporting player. That said, Jo Van Fleet, who won that year for East of Eden, owes Russell a bit of thanks.

Granted, _Picnic_ isn't perfect. The melodrama can get a bit heavy at times, but it hit far more often than it misses, and the best scenes stay with you long after the credits roll. It may not be a great film, but it is a very, very good one.

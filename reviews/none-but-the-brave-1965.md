_None But the Brave_ is notable chiefly as the only film directed by Frank Sinatra. Despite a nearly 60-year film career, this was the only time Ol' Blue Eyes stepped behind the camera, and while he's certainly no David Lean, Sinatra doesn't embarrass himself either.

The story takes place on a small, remote island in the Pacific occupied by a small group of Japanese soldiers, cut off from their supply lines, and essentially marooned. They soon have company however, once an American plane full of marines fresh out of boot camp crash-lands on the opposite side of the island.

The Japanese cast, headed by Tatsuya Mihashi is great. The American cast, however, is somewhat of a mixed bag. Clint Walker is fine, albeit a bit stereotypical, as the steel-jawed captain, while Tommy Sands (who likely got the part because he was married at the time to Sinatra's daughter Nancy) is just a caricature as an eager Marine Lieutenant. Though he has top billing among the American cast, Sinatra's is a supporting role as a boozing medic. He's not really right for the part, but it's easy to overlook that given his easy charm and considerable presence.

The film itself is reminiscent of the superior <span data-imdb-id="tt0050212">_Bridge on the River Kwai_</span>, though Sinatra still does a good job illustrating the futility of war. That said, the final caption is overkill, and _None But the Brave_ does feel a little too orchestrated, though not so much that Sinatra's point is eclipsed by his methods, ala Oliver Stone or Paul Haggis.

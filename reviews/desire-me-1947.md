Mitchum and Hart are French soldiers held captive by the Germans in a prison camp during the waning days of World War II where Mitchum passes the days by telling Hart all about his wife, Garson. The two try to escape, but only Hart makes it. Believing Mitchum dead, Hart takes up with Garson, but thing get complicated when Mitchum returns home alive.

It's a convoluted mess of a movie, told in a series of flashbacks within flashbacks, that at least four directors worked on (including George Cukor and Mervyn LeRoy) but none of which wanted their name attached to the final product, leaving it with no director credit at all. That should tell you all you need to know.

A married barrister (Gregory Peck) defends a beautiful woman on trial for killing her rich husband.

_The Paradine Case_ is a disappointing drama from director Alfred Hitchcock that should have been much better.

The fault isn’t Hitchcock’s, but rather producer David O. Selznick, who insisted on having a hand in everything from the screenplay, to the casting, and even the final editing.

While we may never know what the original screenplay or unedited version of the film looked like, the casting is certainly a disaster.

Gregory Peck is totally wrong for the lead. Not only is he too young and decidedly American, but his entire rugged stature is ill suited for the part. Hitchcock wanted Laurence Olivier, who would have been perfect and absolutely believable as a mild mannered barrister approaching middle age who falls under the spell of a beautiful murder suspect. Peck is far too chiseled, and thus it’s harder to believe that this woman could take him in.

As for the woman, Alida Valli does a descent job, but pales next to Hitchcock’s original choice, Ingrid Bergman. Not only would the role play against type for Bergman, thus making it easier for the audience to sympathize with her character, but also placing her stunning charm next to Olivier would have made for a sensational pairing.

_The Paradine Case_ marked the last collaboration between O. Selznick and Hitchcock and it seems as though the end couldn’t come fast enough for either man. The film feels lazy, as if both men had lost interest in it, which is a real shame considering what might have been.

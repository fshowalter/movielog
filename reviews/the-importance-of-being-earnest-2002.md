Based on the play by Oscar Wilde, in turn-of-the-century London, two men (Rupert Everett and Colin Firth) adapt the pseudonym of "Earnest" to escape from their respective responsibilities, but run into trouble when their respective loves will only settle for "Earnest."

_The Importance of Being Earnest_ is a rare breed. It's a period comedy based on a hundred-year-old play that's not only funny, it feels as fresh as if it were just written today. While the majority of the credit has to go to the source material (Oscar Wilde's wit was a century ahead of its time) some credit is also due director and screenwriter Oliver Parker, as well as the cast, particularly leads Rupert Everett and Colin Firth.

The rapid-fire dialog, chalk full of great lines, and the easy chemistry between Everett and Firth brings to mind some of Billy Wilder's better films. There isn't an ounce of seriousness to the whole film, yet somehow, it doesn't feel like fluff either. Perhaps itâ€™s the lush production.

Even Reese Witherspoon works out okay. Though she's clearly meant to boost the film's American appeal, and though her accent slips from time to time, she's not the casting misstep you might think. Instead, she holds her own against Firth and Everett, and even manages to steal a scene or two with Frances O'Connor.

In the end, _The Importance of Being Earnest_ might not be for everyone, but for those that love dialog-driven comedy, it's a must-see.

A Boston druggist (John Wayne) travels to California where he rivals a local heavy (Albert Dekker) for the attentions of a saloon singer (Binnie Barnes).

_In Old California_ offers a different look for John Wayne early on, as his top hat and topcoat are a far cry from the ten-gallon Stetson and jeans we're used to seeing the Duke wear. It's a nice change, and one that amplifies the story's early light comedy. Unfortunately, this proves to be the film's high point.

The supporting cast is a mixed bag. Albert Dekker is solid as the chief baddie, but Edgar Kennedy is a poor substitution for Gabby Hayes or Walter Brennan as Wayne's sidekick. Further, while Binnie Barnes and Helen Parrish are certainly a step above the female leads in Wayne's earlier Lone Star westerns, neither makes much of an impression.

The biggest problem though is that _In Old California_ is a 55-minute movie stretched to 88. After a fun beginning and solid first act, the movie runs out of steam as it limps toward an underwhelming climax that robs Dekker's character of all of his edge. This, combined with the weak supporting cast and moderate production values, makes _In Old California_ something of a disappointment that's worth a look only for die-hard Wayne fans.

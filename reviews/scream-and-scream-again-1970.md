Here's a curious entry: a British horror that spends most of its time pretending to be a police procedural, throws in some Cold War paranoia, and features three of horror's greatest stars in what amounts to extended cameos. The remarkable thing about _Scream and Scream Again_ is not that it works despite these eccentricities, but that it works because of them.

The film opens juggling three disparate storylines. We have a jogger who wakes up in a hospital to discover his leg has been amputated (and the nightmare is just beginning). We have a fascist state where an intelligence officer named Konratz dispatches his superiors with a Vulcan death grip. And we have police (but not Scotland Yard) investigating a series of murders where young women are found drained of blood.

For the first fifteen minutes, I was lost. This is intentional, and it's the film's greatest strength. By refusing to provide easy connections or comfortable exposition, director Gordon Hessler forces us to pay attention in a way that conventional horror films rarely demand.

The police procedural, which dominates the screen time, is surprisingly effective. Alfred Marks plays Detective Superintendent Bellaver with such matter-of-fact competence that when he casually dislodges a superhuman killer from a cliff face with a well-thrown rock, his deadpan "Right, get 'em" elicited a surprising guffaw. The car chase that precedes this moment holds its own against big-budget Hollywood fare as one of the better action sequences of the period, thanks to the backseat-POV shots putting us in the car weaving in and out of traffic at maximum speed, helpless, with each bend or turn potentially masking an oncoming car. 

And about those famous names on the marquee: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, and Peter Cushing barely register as an ensemble. Amicus producer Milton Stubosky negotiated Vincent Price down from his standard rate of $75,000 to $40,000, and used the savings to book three days of Lee's time, and one day of Cushing's.[^1]

Thus, Cushing appears in a single scene, while Lee appears in a mere handful. Only Price gets substantial screen time, and he's clearly lost but enjoying himself as a scientist whose experiments in human enhancement have gotten rather out of hand. As Lee later revealed, neither he nor Price understood the script.[^2]

Indeed, the film walks a tonal tightrope between serious thriller and high camp. When the three plot threads finally converge in the last fifteen minutes, the explanation is completely preposterous--but it's grounded in recognizable anxieties about political power, scientific arrogance, and the mythology of the perfect Soviet superman. 

Though he takes bottom-line billing to the horror icons, Michael Gothard deserves special mention as the "Vampire Killer." He brings a combination of charm and menace that makes him genuinely unsettling. When he scales that cliff at inhuman speed, Gothard sells the moment not through special effects but through the conviction of his performance.

The film's greatest weakness is also its greatest strength: it leaves many questions unanswered. Some viewers will find this frustrating, but I found it refreshing. In an era when horror films often over-explain their mysteries, _Scream and Scream Again_ trusts us to fill in the blanks and draw our own conclusions. 

That ambiguity only amplifies its paranoid undertones. This is not the gothic Hammer horror that fans of the three stars might expect. It's contemporary, gritty, and surprisingly thoughtful about the intersection of science, politics, and human nature. It's the kind of film that gets better the more you think about it, which is more than can be said for most horror movies of any era.

## And Now, a Bit of Speculation

Were it made by Hammer instead of Amicus, a few script tweaks to _Scream and Scream Again_ could have rebooted one of Hammer’s iconic franchises. To discuss further, I’ll need to reveal the film’s finale.

**Last spoiler warning.**

Still here? Okay, in the finale, we learn Vincent Price has been building “composites,” new people composed of the parts of others. These beings have supernatural strength, feel no pain, and heal preternaturally with no scarring. Gothard was his first specimen to exhibit autonomous intelligence, but clearly wasn’t perfect. A further twist reveals Price himself as a composite, part of a larger network seeking to remake humanity as a better species.

Does this plot sound familiar? In 1970, Hammer released <span data-imdb-id="tt0065851">_The Horror of Frankenstein_</span>, hoping to reboot the franchise without star Peter Cushing. It flopped and Cushing was back four years later in <span data-imdb-id="tt0071519">_Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell_</span>.

But what if, instead, Hammer had made this movie, with one slight change? What if they cut Cushing’s cameo scene and left his name off the marquee? Then, at the film’s end, after Lee shows up to save the day and vanquish Price (revealing himself as a composite in the process) we cut back to the unnamed fascist state. The camera follows an officer down a hallway into a laboratory similar to Price’s. Standing with his back to us, a man wearing a lab coat works over a table:

> OFFICER (with an Eastern European accent):<br>
> Browning has been terminated.
>
> The man in the lab coat grunts but keeps working, his back still to us.
>
> OFFICER:<br>
> Konratz too.
>
> The man in the lab coat offers no response.
>
> OFFICER (hesitantly):<br>
> It was him.
>
> The man in the lab coat stops and turns, revealing himself as Cushing.
>
> OFFICER:<br>
> What shall we do, Herr Frankenstein?
>
> CLOSE UP on Cushing, who cracks an evil smile.
>
> Cut to credits.

Wouldn’t that be something? Reinventing the Frankenstein franchise as a contemporary paranoid thriller, with Cushing and Lee once again opposite one-another. Later entries could focus on either star, as they fleshed out the world and explored contemporary Cold War fears.

Sadly, Hammer was too late to abandon its period horrors. Their late-to-the-party attempt at contemporary horror, <span data-imdb-id="tt0075334">_To the Devil a Daughter_</span>, made in the wake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0063522">_Rosemary’s Baby_</span>’s commercial success, was their last theatrical feature. Maybe pivoting earlier with a movie like this one might have saved them. Alas, we’ll never know.

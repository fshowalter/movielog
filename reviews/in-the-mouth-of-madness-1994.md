Neill plays an insurance investigator sent to track down mysterious author Sutter Cane, whose latest books seems to be driving readers into homicidal rampages.

There's an interesting premise here, but it's regulated to bookending a routine haunted town story. Neill and Prochnow are more than capable, as is director Carpenter, making this feel like something of a cop-out.

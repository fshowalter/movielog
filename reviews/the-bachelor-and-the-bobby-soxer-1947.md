_The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer_ is a fun, if completely fantastic, comedy that shines thanks to a sublime comedy performance from star Cary Grant, a charming turn from Myrna Loy, and a well-done effort from Shirley Temple.

The plot sees judge Loy convinces playboy artist Grant to date her teenage sister Temple in order to dispel the young girl's crush on him.

Grant makes the film. He's funny from the get-go, all the while exuding his considerable charm and elegance. Take the nightclub scene involving all of the leads. Grant steals it, despite everyone talking all over his lines, and the end of the scene, with Grant, wet from his own drink, eyeing the waiter is laugh out loud funny, a true rarity among screwball comedies.

The reason for this is that unlike most screwball films, no-one in _The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer_ acts like a self-absorbed child. Even Temple, who actually plays a self-absorbed child, goes out of her way to act like an adult in a well-tempered performance that could easily have veered into annoying. It's this aspect, combined with the always-cool Myrna Loy that makes the film funny despite the foolish premise.

Thus, for fans of either Cary Grant or Myrna Loy, _The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer_ is a must-see, though others, provided they can get past the goofy premise, should enjoy it as well.

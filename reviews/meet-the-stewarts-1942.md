A man (William Holden) marries a woman (Frances Dee) from a rich family, then discovers she can’t live within a budget.

_Meet the Stewarts_ is a surprisingly funny film. Instead of trying for laughs through physical comedy or grating situations (both pretty standard for comedies of the time), _Meet the Stewarts_ instead offers up a script with some pretty good lines.

It doesn’t hurt that Frances Dee has a faint echo of Rosalind Russell, in that she has a certain toughness about her that prevents her from seeming too coy, especially in her scenes opposite William Holden.

And it’s Holden that really anchors the film. He makes a fantastic straight man who comes across as both likable and relatable, and his character’s willingness to stand up (or at least try) to Frances Dee’s is a refreshing change.

Adding to this is the film’s brief 73 minute running time, which keeps it from wearing out its welcome.

While it’s no classic, _Meet the Stewarts_ is funnier than it has any right to be.

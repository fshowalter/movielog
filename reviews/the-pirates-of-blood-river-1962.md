A pirate (Christopher Lee) forces an escaped prisoner (Kerwin Mathews) to reveal the location of a remote settlement where he hopes to find treasure.

Despite the opening shot of a pirate ship at sea, _Pirates of Blood River_ takes place almost entirely on land. Where that land is supposed to be is left up to the viewer to decide, though one may have a hard time coming up with a place replete with English forests, colonial forts, and piranhas.

That said, after a good beginning featuring said piranhas, the film drags. Christopher Lee does what he can, and his pirate co-stars are entertaining, especially Oliver Reed as a drunken lecherous sailor, but soon it becomes clear that they're never getting a back on the ship and as the film devolves into a would-be western.

The problem is that the film lacks the thrills usually present in a Hammer Production. The violence is tame, and the script stalls through most of the second act. Things pick up a bit at the finale, including a laugh-out-loud death scene by Christopher Lee, but not enough to make this one worth your time. A little more edge would have gone a long way.

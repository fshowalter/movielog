After the surprise success of <span data-imdb-id="tt0083929">_Fast Times at Ridgemont High_</span>, studios rushed several copycats into production.

The plot sees Deborah Foreman as girl from the valley falls for Nicholas Cage, a new wave boy from the city, much to the dismay of her friends.

Unfortunately, the movie, like the stereotypical title character, simply doesn’t have much to it. It’s a love story where you don’t particularly care if the characters will end up together, because you already know they will. It’s a satire that has nothing to satirize except the way a few characters talk. It’s a sex comedy without the sex.

It’s not all bad, however. The soundtrack is pretty good, the valley girl dialog is worth a chuckle, and Nicolas Cage has a moment or two of inspired weirdness, but that’s about it.

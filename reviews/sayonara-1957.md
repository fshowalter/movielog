Brando plays a General's son who throws away a promising career in the Air Force to marry the star Japanese performer of all-female production company in this well produced but underwhelming melodrama.

Logan seems to be making a theatrical romance meditating on the nature of performance while Brando seems to be making a dark introspective drama. The two visions cross paths every once in a while, but the result is overlong and uneven.

In prohibition-era Chicago, a group of charitable mobsters (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.) takes on an ambitious rival (Peter Falk) and a corrupt Sheriff (Victor Buono).

_Robin and the 7 Hoods_ is a fairly ingenious retelling of the Robin Hood legend transplanted to prohibition-era Chicago that marked the last theatrically released musical for co-star Bing Crosby. It also, arguably, marked the final "Rat Pack" film, though Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop aren't present due to falling out of favor with star Frank Sinatra. That said, the film is pretty good, if a bit long, though you've got to wonder why it took three films before Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. thought to make a musical together.

Performance wise, Sinatra once again proves to be the weakest link, as his distaste for rehearsals or multiple takes shows through in an effort that barely holds up next to the polished ease of Martin, or the studious professionalism of Davis or Crosby. While he could get away with it in <span data-imdb-id="tt0054135">_Ocean's Eleven_</span>, this film's period setting and song-and-dance numbers require a more concentrated effort than Sinatra seems willing to offer, and the film suffers because of it.

The second big problem is the length. At just over two hours, _Robin and the 7 Hoods_ is easily 20 minutes too long, with far too many endings. Indeed, the film just seems to go on and on, until it finally ends in a rather abrupt and somewhat unsatisfying manner that's clearly meant to invoke the ending of Ocean's Eleven, though it doesn't quite work.

Fortunately, neither of these two issues really kills the film. The good musical numbers and strong supporting cast serve as great compensation, as does the great production. Hell, the revival-meeting scene alone almost makes the two hours worth it. For Rat Pack fans this one's a must see, and others could certainly do a lot worse.

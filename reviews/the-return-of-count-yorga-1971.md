Quarry is back as Yorga, this time in San Francisco, preying on the staff of a neighboring orphanage.

Though it features Yorga and his valet Brudda, this isn't really a sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0066952">_Count Yorga, Vampire_</span> but rather a completely separate film with the same characters, one that seems to have been rushed out to capitalize on the success of the prior film.

This time, Kelljan goes from innovator to imitator, first aping his own material by placing Quarry at a masquerade party where everyone assumes his getup must be a costume, and then borrowing from George Romero's landmark <span data-imdb-id="tt0063350">_Night of the Living Dead_</span> in the staging of the home invasion set-piece and painting Quarry's dirt-covered harem as a shambling horde of zombies rather than erotic sirens.

Thankfully, Quarry's still great as Yorga, which keeps this from being a total loss, but it _is_ a disappointment.

A sorority girl (Christina Ricci) with a seemingly perfect life discovers the repercussions of falling in love with a disabled man (Hank Harris).

_Pumpkin_ is an insightful and entertaining little movie that's one part satire and one part genuine drama. It's the interplay between these parts that leaves the best impression, as the viewer is left to decide how much of the movie was sincere and how much was black comedy.

Early on it's easy enough: the character's are cookie-cutter stereotypes, and the stilted dialog and over-acting fit right in, but as the story progresses--and the characters seemingly become more human--it becomes a more and more tricky right up to the ending, which reinforces this ambiguity perfectly.

The acting is excellent, with Hank Harris in particular turning in impressive performance.

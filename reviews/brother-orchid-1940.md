_Brother Orchid_ is a pretty absurd film made workable by the charisma of its stars.

The plot sees Edward G. Robinson play a gangster convalescing in a monastery after his one-time partner, played by Humphrey Bogart, leaves him for dead.

Robinson is good in the lead, although you can't help thinking that James Cagney would have been even better. Supporting Robinson, Bogart is great. One year away from his breakout combination of <span data-imdb-id="tt0033717">_High Sierra_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0033870">_The Maltese Falcon_</span>, Bogart is all smooth menace. Also giving a fine supporting turn is perennial character actor Ralph Bellamy, who manages to steal all of his scenes as a good ole' Southern boy. Indeed, the only weak link, casting-wise, is Ann Sothern, who pales next to the innate presence of the other players.

And it's that presence that distracts you from the story's silly premise. Fortunately, director Lloyd Bacon seems to realize this and never takes anything too seriously, even delivering some real comedy, such as the shot of Robinson in his robe, or just about all of Bellamy's scenes.

That said, _Brother Orchid_ isn't a good film. At best, it's an okay one that succeeds in spite of itself. That's damning praise, sure, but that's about as good as it gets.

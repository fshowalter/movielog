Homer inadvertently dooms Springfield to destruction by failing to resist the lure of free donuts.

_The Simpsons Movie_ is, against all odds, good. While it only runs a scant 87 minutes, it’s still impressive that the script is able to maintain the series’ distinct brand of irreverent humor throughout the entire film (and even into the credits).

In fact, the whole movie plays like a very good (albeit longer) episode of the series. And while this isn’t a bad thing (the movie even jokes about it), you can’t help but wish they’d taken better advantage of the format and the budget.

Also, the movie does date itself at various places, so it may not age as well as it otherwise would. But now I’m really nit-picking.

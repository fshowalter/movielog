Two singing ballplayers (Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly) attempt to woo their team’s owner (Esther Williams) and avoid a gambler (Edward Arnold).

_Take Me Out to the Ball Game_ was made during a lull in Frank Sinatra’s career and thus, despite receiving top billing, he’s not really the lead. This is a shame because while both are good in their roles (Kelly plays a womanizing playboy and Sinatra plays pretty much the opposite) they would play much better reversed.

Thankfully, aside from that blunder and Betty Garrett (who comes across pretty flat) the rest of the cast is quite good. Esther Williams acquits herself well out of the pool, and Edward Arnold is solid as ever.

The musical numbers are pleasantly brief, and the film’s 93 minute running time keeps it from wearing out its welcome, although it should be noted that, for a baseball movie, there’s very little actual baseball.

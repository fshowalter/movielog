A government agent must recover stolen vials of a deadly virus from a madman determined to rule the world.

_The Satan Bug_ is director John Sturges inexplicable follow-up to The Great Escape.

Gone are the wide open spaces that he utilized to such great effect in films like <span data-imdb-id="tt0057115">_The Great Escape_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0054047">_The Magnificent Seven_</span>, and <span data-imdb-id="tt0045737">_Escape From Fort Bravo_</span>, instead they're replaced by soundstage lab sets that date the film horribly.

Missing also, is a star-sudden ensemble cast in the vein of _The Great Escape_ or _The Magnificent Seven_. Here, Sturges commands a stable of mostly B-movie veterans led by former TV star George Maharis. While theyâ€™re all surprisingly serviceable, no one is a real standout and the film suffers for it.

The script by James Clavell and Edward Anhalt from the Alistair MacLean novel bears a passing resemblance to a season of the Fox television series _24_, though it's neither tense nor believable and loses what little momentum it has in the third act.

A teen inexplicably kills his girlfriend and provokes strange reactions from his peers after showing them the body.

_River's Edge_ is almost the anti-teen movie. There are no happy endings or neat plot resolutions. Instead we get an honest look at dysfunctional families and disenchanted youth. While this does make for great social commentary, it's less than satisfying as a movie.

The performances are all first rate. Crispin Glover's does tend to veer a little over-the-top, but you buy it. Dennis Hopper may have been filming _River's Edge_ concurrently with <span data-imdb-id="tt0090756">_Blue Velvet_</span>, as he gives almost identical performances, but you buy him too.

Director Tim Hunter does a great job creating a real-world atmosphere, and manages to keep the film from dating itself. The lack of cell phones is about the only way you'd know it wasn't set in present day.

_River's Edge_'s only real problems are its length (it's about 15-20 minutes too long), and its lack of story. The movie seems more intent on exploring its character's reactions, rather than trying to unify those reactions with a central thread or theme. This isn't to say there isn't a central theme, only that it's often sacrificed for the sake of exploration, resulting in a looser narrative.

A scientist (Boris Karloff) becomes obsessed with the idea of communicating with his dead wife.

_The Devil Commands_ is a solid, if forgettable, mad-scientist flick that could have been something special.

Director Edward Dmytryk (who would direct <span data-imdb-id="">_Murder, My Sweet_</span> just three years later) does a wonderful job creating atmosphere--for the most part. The decision to use what appear to be modified diving helmets as props is regrettable, as the result is laughable and drags down what are otherwise some solid production values.

Still, Karloff is great in the lead, and the script has potential. The first half of the film works very well, leading up to a great scene where Karloff’s character debunks a phony medium.

Then the film seems to run out of steam, as the traditional mad scientist formula takes over, replete with a nosey sheriff and an angry mob of townspeople. Dmytryk and Karloff do what they can, but compared to the first half, this feels like a letdown. Fortunately, the 65-minute running time means it’s all over pretty quick.

On a side note, the title has virtually nothing to do with the film, as there are no references at all to the devil, or his commands.

In 1933 Cuba, after her brother is killed by the secret police, a woman (Jennifer Jones) joins an underground plot hatched by an American expatriate (John Garfield).

_We Were Strangers_ is an interesting, but fatally flawed, blend of the political thriller, film noir, and romance genres from director John Huston.

Looking at it in the context of Huston's career, it's clear _We Were Strangers_ was something of a bridge between the film that preceded it, <span data-imdb-id="tt0040506">_Key Largo_</span>, and the film that followed it, <span data-imdb-id="tt0042208">_The Asphalt Jungle_</span>, with Huston retaining the romantic drama of _Key Largo_, but introducing the stark black and white photography and criminals-as-protagonists elements would feature so prominently in _The Asphalt Jungle_.

That said, the film just doesn't work. It stumbles early, with a long and rather talky opening before finally finding its footing once John Garfield shows up and gets things rolling. Jennifer Jones is passable as the supposedly Cuban lead, but her accent slips more than once, as it does with many of the other Americans posing as Cubans, lending an aura of incredulity to the whole proceedings.

But worst of all, _We Were Strangers_ never engages the audience. It's an ambitious film that tries to be a little bit of everything, but succeeds at nothing, resulting in a film that, aside from some great cinematography during the finale, has little to recommend it.

An outlaw (Frank Sinatra) and a sheriff (George Kennedy) tangle over a strongbox, Indians, and a schoolteacher.

_Dirty Dingus Magee_ is a would-be slapstick western in the vein of director Burt Kennedy's earlier success, <span data-imdb-id="tt0065642">_Support Your Local Sheriff_</span> that unfortunately, never works.

For starters, the film is more bawdy cartoon then comedy, as most of its gags seem to rely on their (at the time) outlandishness for laughs. Viewed today, the film just feels flat and lazy, with lead Frank Sinatra sleepwalking though a ridiculous script. Costar George Kennedy does what he can, but he's no leading man, and it isn't until Jack Elam shows up near the film's finale that the film gets its first real laughs.

Sinatra was in his mid fifties when the film was made, but he looks ten years older. Further, he seems tired. It's well known that Sinatra didn't like to rehearse and preferred single takes, but rarely has his total disregard for the material shown through as it does here, and thus, it's no surprise that Sinatra would go on to announce his retirement a year later.

All and all, there really isn't anything to recommend _Dirty Dingus Magee_. If you want a western comedy, watch _Support Your Local Sheriff_, if you want a western buddy actioner, watch <span data-imdb-id="tt0062472">_The War Wagon_</span>, if you want a cartoonish western, watch <span data-imdb-id="tt0080097">_The Villain_</span>, and if you want a western parody, watch <span data-imdb-id="tt0071230">_Blazing Saddles_</span>, all of which are better than this unfunny, awkward mess.

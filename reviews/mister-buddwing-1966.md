You'd be forgiven if you thought the lost look on Garner's face was acting, seeing as how he plays an apparent amnesiac trying to piece together his identity, but in reality he's just as confused by the film's script as the rest of us.

This mess of a movie hints at a David Lynch-esque mystery but you see the pat ending coming long before Garner's character does, making the last quarter an exercise in patience.

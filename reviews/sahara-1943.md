Humphrey Bogart may have top billing but _Sahara_ is an ensemble picture.

Bogart plays an American sergeant leading a group of allied soldiers on a retreat across the North African desert.

The various allied soldiers are all well written, especially Rex Ingram as a Sudanese soldier, and everyone gets a moment to shine. The Germans on the other hand, are a bit more one-dimensional, but given that this was basically a propaganda film this isn’t surprising.

The well-done action scenes and the somewhat somber third act make Sahara hold up well over time. Of course, having Bogart in the cast doesn’t hurt either.

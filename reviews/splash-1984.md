A man (Tom Hanks) falls in love with a mermaid (Daryl Hannah) he encountered in his youth.

I remembered _Splash_ being much funnier than it actually is. As a boy, I was blissfully ignorant of the plot holes you could drive a truck through and the lack of chemistry between Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, but watching it now, _Splash_ is just "okay".

Sure, John Candy and Eugene Levy are good (although the former is criminally underutilized) and the underwater photography is excellent, but with a running time just shy of two hours, this light-hearted story is much too long. Better pacing and a shorter running time could have helped conceal some of the aforementioned flaws and made for a more satisfying experience.

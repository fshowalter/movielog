Cage plays a drug and gambling addicted cop in post-Katrina New Orleans investigating the execution style slaying of an immigrant family.

Herzog does a great job grounding the film in the dirty, flood-ravaged streets of New Orleans, and Cage shows flashes of his younger brilliance as the lead, but while Herzog insists he never saw Abel Ferrara's <span data-imdb-id="tt0103759">_Bad Lieutenant_</span>, the screenwriters certainly did, as the script is nothing but a pastiche of the corrupt cop genre, bringing nothing new to the table.

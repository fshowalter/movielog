A British ex-con (Terence Stamp) travels to Los Angeles to investigate his daughter's death.

Lets get this out of the way right off: Terence Stamp is a freakin' _tour-de-force_ in _The Limey_. He chews scenery like few actors in recent memory and just _owns_ the screen. The presence he commands from the opening scene onward is so strong you can't help but wonder why he never became a bigger star.

That said, the movie is great. The montage editing style employed by director Steven Soderbergh, while initially somewhat confusing, serves the story well by keeping the viewer off balance and adding another layer to an already nuanced movie. The casting of Peter Fonda was a stroke of genius, as it elevates _The Limey_ beyond the revenge genre into social commentary.

The only real flaw to the movie is it's own simplicity. It never tries to be anything more than the simple story it is, but after watching it, you might find yourself wishing Soderbergh had tried something more epic.

Romero treats this quintet of tales inspired by the E.C. comics of the 50s with love, but not reverence, resulting in a lot of good, campy fun.

Leslie Nielsen gives a standout performance in the well-titled "Something To Tide You Over," and King himself getting in on the fun as a bumbling yokel in "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill." The film only stumbles with its final segment, "They're Creeping Up On You," which goes straight for the gross-out. According to the IMDb, King's script had the story taking place in a lush penthouse apartment, but logistical problems forced Romero to use an antiseptic, almost futurist set that takes the viewer right out of the story. Still, four out of five ain't bad.

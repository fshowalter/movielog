A watermelon farmer (Charles Bronson) incurs the wrath of various underworld figures when he refuses to cooperate.

_Mr. Majestyk_ is one of Charles Bronson's best vehicles. In it, he plays a quiet, but strong man who just wants to be left in peace to do an honest day's work. Sound familiar? Dozens of action films in the 70s and 80s used a similar formula, but _Mr. Majestyk_ stands head and shoulders above most of them.

Some of the credit has to go to Elmore Leonard's script, which offers some originality while at the same time indulging our desire to root for an underdog; but the rest of the credit goes to Bronson. This movie, along with <span data-imdb-id="tt0071402">_Death Wish_</span>, cemented his image as a tough loner willing to take the law into his own hands. His iron countenance and strong screen presence were enhanced by an undeniable sense of authenticity which quickly propelled him to screen legend.

_Mr. Majestyk_'s got it's flaws, sure. It runs maybe 10 minutes too long, and Al Lettieri's performance is a bit too over-the-top, but these are minor issues. Watch _Mr. Majestyk_ for Bronson and you won't be disappointed.

_Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison_ is an enjoyable film built around a solid script and great performances from the leads.

The film stars Robert Mitchum as a marine stranded on a South Pacific island with a nun played by Deborah Kerr.

The script by director John Huston and John Lee Mahin is littered with great dialog and does a great job maintaining the tension, both sexual and otherwise, while never becoming too serious.

The performances are great. Mitchum gives one of the best performances of his career in a role that seems written for him, while Kerr also is completely charming in a role that could have easily come across as annoying.

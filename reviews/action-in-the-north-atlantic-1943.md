_Action in the North Atlantic_ is an entertaining and surprisingly violent action picture with a fair amount of wartime propaganda thrown in.

The story showcases the trials of a Merchant Marine crew during World War II.

With scenes including crewman being chewed up by propellers, blown up by dropped bombs, and the violent drowning deaths of German U-Boat crews, _Action in the North Atlantic_ is pretty brutal. The graphic nature, along with the filmmaker’s decision to have the German characters speak German and nothing but German, amounts to refreshing diversion from many of the war pictures of the time.

Unfortunately, _Action in the North Atlantic_ also contains a fair amount of wartime propaganda, but the film likely wouldn't have made it past the censors without it.

The special effects are spectacular, especially the opening submarine attack. Seeing Humphrey Bogart surrounded by fire and racing around a sinking ship that’s breaking apart at the seams is impressive, camera trick or not, and serves to heighten the film’s sense of realism.

As for Bogart, he does a great job in his first post-Casablanca role. Further, while he may have top billing, he doesn’t have to carry the show. Unlike many war pictures, _Action in the North Atlantic_ does a good job fleshing out the supporting cast members and giving each a moment to shine, and as a result, the film feels more like an ensemble picture rather than a one-man army.

Granted, the film does drag a bit toward the middle, when the crew makes shore, but fortunately, this bit is short-lived, and they’re soon back at sea as the action and tension begin to mount leading to a classic finale that would inspire such films as <span data-imdb-id="tt0050356">_The Enemy Below_</span>.

A prominent brain surgeon (Basil Rathbone) stops at nothing in quest to cure his wife’s brain tumor.

_The Black Sleep_ is, for the first three quarters, a well-done mad scientist film. Then it all goes to hell.

Basil Rathbone’s performance is both sympathetic and horrifying, while Akim Tamiroff turns in a suitably sleazy gypsy who furnishes Rathbone’s character with specimens.

The rest of the cast, however, leaves something to be desired. Despite having third, forth, and fifth billing, former Universal Monster stars Lon Chaney Jr., John Carradine, and Bela Lugosi have little more than bit parts, with Lugosi’s being the final of his career.

Still, the film manages to hold together fairly well until final quarter when the abrupt and tremendously silly finale kicks in. It’s a real shame as the film had a lot of potential, despite its squandering of its considerable talent.

Morel plays a stiff sergeant leading a group of POWs in a Japanese prison camp ruled by cartoonishly sadistic jailers. There's a great twist that I won't spoil, so suffice it to say there's a ticking clock Morell's working against. This film makes no attempt at high drama ala Bridge on the River Kwai, it's a well-done exploitation piece that delivers the goods and sticks the landing.

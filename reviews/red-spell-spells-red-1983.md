Here's a movie that wants to be everything and ends up being nothing much at all. _Red Spell Spells Red_ is a Hong Kong exploitation film that seems to have been assembled from a checklist of what worked in other people's movies, without any understanding of why those elements worked in the first place.

The story follows a documentary crew from Hong Kong to Malaysia, where they manage to unleash something called the Red Dwarf ghost. The ghost follows them to Borneo and begins the obligatory process of picking them off one by one. But the creators seem less interested in telling this story than in recreating moments from a dozen other films.

We get the low, prowling camera work of Sam Raimi's <span data-imdb-id="tt0083907">_The Evil Dead_</span>. The exotic menace and animal slaughter of Ruggero Deodato's <span data-imdb-id="tt0078935">_Cannibal Holocaust_</span>. Scorpions by the bucketful, apparently because someone saw <span data-imdb-id="tt0100472">_Calamity of Snakes_</span> and thought more was better. Even <span data-imdb-id="tt0075005">_The Omen_</span> gets pillaged for its Latin chanting.

The film's schizophrenic borrowing makes for incoherent storytelling. Characters struggle against forces that may or may not be real. Dreams become reality, then dreams again, with no logic governing the transitions. The movie climaxes with a freeze-frame that suggests the producers simply ran out of money mid-sentence.

Yet there are moments when the madness almost works. A scene involving a possessed editing machine that strangles its operator with film stock shows genuine invention, even if it's later dismissed as hallucination. The finale, with heroine Poon Lai-Yin strapped to a water wheel cranking her through cycles of submersion and exposure while wearing a strategically transparent white shirt, delivers genuine exploitative spectacle.

But the film's fatal flaw is its lack of commitment. _The Evil Dead_ worked because it embraced its absurdity with manic glee. _Cannibal Holocaust_ succeeded through uncompromising brutality. _Red Spell Spells Red_ hedges its bets, never fully committing to comedy or horror, camp or sincerity.

Poon Lai-Yin tries gamely in the lead, but lacks the charismatic presence that might have elevated the material. She's no Bruce Campbell, and this film desperately needs someone who can sell the preposterous with conviction.

For audiences seeking mindless exploitation, this may suffice. It moves fast, delivers periodic shocks, and doesn't overstay its welcome. But for those hoping for something more than competent hackwork, _Red Spell Spells Red_ spells disappointment.

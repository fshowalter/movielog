A new student (Lindsay Lohan) joins an elite clique of beautiful girls in the hopes of sabotaging them, but soon finds herself in too deep.

_Mean Girls_ is the best teen comedy in a decade, largely because it's not written for teens.

_Mean Girls_ is written for the twenty and thirty somethings; people who can remember what it was like to be a teenager, but are far enough removed that they can look with perspective. It's not to say teens won't enjoy the movie and find humor in it, but the movie's true target audience skews slightly older.

A good script can be wasted on bad actors, which may explain why so few good teen movies have been written since the heyday of John Hughes, but the performers in _Mean Girls_ don't disappoint. Lindsay Lohan carries the movie with charm and grace, and writer Tina Fey gives herself and fellow <acronym title="Saturday Night Live">SNL</acronym> alum Tim Meadows some great supporting roles.

A hard-luck sportswriter (Humphrey Bogart) hypes a naïve Argentinean boxer for the mob.

_The Harder They Fall_ is perhaps most notable as Humphrey Bogart’s final film, but that shouldn’t overshadow the film itself.

Bogart looks the part of a tired, down on his luck sportswriter. His eyes have a beaten quality that shows the viewer in a single glance that his character has no illusions about life. Most likely this was due to his battle with lung cancer, and the fact that he was sick while making the film. Yet he retains the undeniable charisma that made him a star.

Opposite Bogart is the equally well cast Rod Steiger, who plays a young amoral mobster willing to use anyone or anything around him to make a buck. Steiger injects just enough showman into the part to be credible, but avoids overdoing it.

The script by Philip Yordan from the novel by Budd Schulberg keeps things moving quickly and does a great job showing just how the boxing underworld builds up fighters, while at the same time delivering a human drama accessible to non-boxing fans. Granted, the ending is a bit trite, it's not a deal breaker.

Director Mark Robson turns in a sharp looking film, with some excellent cinematography and a very authentic feel, despite the presence of super-star Bogart, who went out on top in a solid film that should appeal to boxing fans and non-boxing fans alike. Recommended.

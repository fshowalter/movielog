Shrek and Fiona return to the land of Far, Far, Away as newlyweds, to find her parents less than enthused that they're both ogres.

_Shrek 2_ takes the first movie's satirization of fairy tales and expands on it by including movies and Hollywood culture itself as fair targets, with the result being just as enjoyable as the first movie.

The returning voice talent is as top-notch as they were the first time around and newcomers Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders are instant classics as the charming Puss In Boots and conniving Fairy Godmother. The only blemish is a criminally underused Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, who really deserved a better written character.

Dreamworks Animation proves itself Pixar's equal here with some truly stunning visuals. Indeed, the whole movie is technically a large leap forward from the first, although wisely the script still seems to have gotten the most attention.

A corrupt Attorney General appoints a black sheriff to a small town in an effort to drive the residents away.

_Blazing Saddles_ is perhaps Mel Brooks's finest movie. Brooks, who directed, co-wrote, and starred, delivers a movie that is simultaneously both a wild satire and a homage to the Western genre. Additionally, _Blazing Saddles_ takes the satire angle one step further by poking fun at the Hollywood system itself with it's inspired ending.

Brooks the director really steps up here. _Blazing Saddles_ feels like a Western, and while a large part of the credit for this goes to the production designer, Brooks also deserves credit for using the same wide shots and dramatic close-ups that the genre is known for, thereby allowing the film to work as a homage in addition to a satire.

While the casting is perfect--Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder make a great on-screen duo and Harvey Korman steals all of his scenes--the real strength here is the script. Just silly enough to maintain the perfect tone, the script is a masterpiece of wordplay. The emphasis on clever dialog and character exaggeration over sight gags is what makes _Blazing Saddles_ special, a point that would be lost on Brooks in his later films.

Granted, _Blazing Saddles_ is not perfect. Some of the gags fall flat, and others lose much of their charm on repeat viewings, but thankfully those are the exception and not the rule.

Four high school seniors make a pact to loose their virginity by prom night.

_American Pie_ is an above average teen sex comedy thanks largely due to a likable cast and an honest script.

Jason Biggs is great as the de-facto lead. He’s the loveable everyman the audience can root for and brings just the right amount of charm and naiveté to the role.

Other standouts on the cast include Eddie Kaye Thomas as the enigmatic Finch, whose closing scenes with Jennifer Coolidge are one of the film’s highlights, Sean William Scott as the arrogant doofus Stifler, and Alyson Hannigan as a precocious flute player.

The film is crude, to be sure, but the humor feels honest nonetheless, and it’s that honesty that helps lift _American Pie_ above the typical genre entry. While the ending is tidy, there’s enough ambiguity that it doesn’t feel pat, and the situations and predicaments still ring true almost ten years later.

Granted, the film isn’t on par with the likes of <span data-imdb-id="tt0829482">_Superbad_</span>, but in many ways _American Pie_ paved the way, reintroducing the hard-R teen sex comedy as a viable genre.

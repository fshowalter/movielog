In post World War II Malaysia, a man (William Holden) finds is increasingly difficult to stay neutral as Communist guerillas clash with the occupying British government.

_The 7th Dawn_ is a beautifully photographed film that aspires to be more than the soap opera it is.

Beginning at the close of the Second World War, the film follows the rise of Communism in Malaysia and, at least initially, does a good job of painting both sides as flawed and stubborn. Through William Holden’s character, we see that no ideology is worth the cost in human lives both sides seem prepared to pay.

Unfortunately, once Susannah York makes an appearance the film goes downhill fast as it quickly devolves into a soap opera. The Communists are now totally evil and Holden’s tramping through the jungle to single-handedly capture their leader. This, in itself wouldn’t be such a bad thing if the film’s first half hadn’t set itself up to be a nuanced treatise on the price of war and the collateral damage it leaves behind.

Compounding all this is an ending that seems to come full circle, expecting us to take the film seriously again, even after Holden’s one-man army routine.

Still, the great use of Malaysian locales and the stunning cinematography make this an easy film to watch, even if it’s ultimately disappointing.

A warrior priest seeks a group of medical students trying to divine the secret of eternal life from the body of Dracula.

_Dracula II: Ascension_ is the sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0219653">_Dracula 2000_</span>. Though it picks up right were the previous film left off, we're introduced to an entirely new set of characters, which makes this installment accessible for viewers who may not have seen the first movie.

Script-wise, \_Dracula II: Ascension --while nowhere near as clever as it's predecessor--is serviceable. There are no clever twists, and much of this movie seems to be a throw-away setup for the third installment, but the introduction of Jason Scott Lee's warrior priest character fills a large void and addresses my biggest complaint with the first movie.

The direction by Patrick Lussier may not be the most unique or inspired, but he does show a marked improvement from the first installment. His decision to avoid cheap gore is a welcome one, and he handles the action scenes with Lee quite well.

Performance wise, the only standout besides Lee is Jason London. The two have enough charisma to carry their scenes and handle their roles well. Diane Neal, the female lead, doesn't fare as well. The script doesn't help her much, but ultimately she doesn't have the raw charisma to carry such a pivotal role.

Vampire fans will find it okay, others beware.

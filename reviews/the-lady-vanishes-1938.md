A young socialite (Margaret Lockwood) tries to prove an elderly governess was actually on a train.

_The Lady Vanishes_ starts poorly, with a sequence involving various characters attempting to secure rooms at an inn. While this does serve to introduce many of the story’s principals, it’s nonetheless slow and awkward. Further, it doesn’t help that Michael Redgrave’s character initially comes across as a self-absorbed ass. Granted this is in keeping with the movie’s central theme that no one is whom they appear to be, but it’s off-putting nonetheless.

Fortunately, once the train gets moving, so does the story. The cast clicks and the plot grabs you and doesn’t let go. The script by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder keeps the audience guessing while simultaneously trusting them to keep up. It paints the protagonists as smart, believable people, as opposed to blundering stereotypes, and even tosses in some great comedy relief in the form of Naunton Wayne’s and Basil Radford’s characters, who proved so popular they would later turn up in several other unrelated films. Granted, there are a few moments where Margaret Lockwood veers very close to the edge, but director Alfred Hitchcock reels her back in.

British spy James Bond (Sean Connery) fakes his own death in order to investigate a series of spacejackings believed to be based out of Japan.

_You Only Live Twice_, the fifth entry in the long-running James Bond series, marked the first time the series abandoned any pretension of a spy thriller, tossing out most of Ian Fleming's source novel and instead opting for a straight-up adventure film, replete with ninjas and a secret volcano lair.

This installment also marked the first, and definitive portrayal of long-time Bond nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played here by Donald Pleasence. The character would appear in the next two films, albeit played by different actors (one of whom, Charles Grey, actually has a bit part in this film), before effectively being written out of the Bond universe due to legal issues.

The film itself is entertaining, if a bit overlong. Connery's "disguise" as a Japanese man is ridiculous, and that whole segment with him posing as a farmer is tedious and unnecessary, but the iconic finale in the secret volcano base is great, as is Pleasence's turn as Blofeld.

That said, your enjoyment with _You Only Live Twice_ will be more or less proportional to your enjoyment of the fantastic adventure elements of the Bond franchise. Those looking for an adult spy thriller will be disappointed, but others should find it pleasing enough.

A fictionalized biography of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, beginning with his arrival in Washington D.C. to join the Supreme Court.

_The Magnificent Yankee_ is an enjoyable enough biopic, thanks largely to the charismatic and boisterous performance from Oscar-nominated lead Louis Calhern, a turn that almost makes up for the film's complete lack of narrative tension and story. Almost.

While Holmes certainly led an interesting life, you'd never know it from this film. There's nothing but a small mention here and there of some of his notable cases, and he seems to get along with everyone. Indeed, much of the film is just a "this happened, then this happened" type of affair, as it chronicles Holmes arrival in Washington, and the succession of clerks who work for him. He gets older, his wife dies, and he eventually retires from the bench. Movie over.

Again, Calhern's certainly a commanding presence, and director John Sturges makes the most out of him, but, watching the movie, you don't really learn anything about Holmes aside from the fact that he got to be pretty old. That, and he had a lot of clerks.

That said, if you're a big fan of Holmes, or Calhern, you'll find the film enjoyable, but anyone else will likely find the lack of substance frustrating.

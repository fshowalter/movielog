A group of super-star actors (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black) shooting a blockbuster war film in Vietnam, find themselves fighting for real when they encounter a drug cartel.

_Tropic Thunder_ is a wonderful satire of both action films and Hollywood that works thanks to a sharp script and some outstanding performances.

The script by director/star Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux is a brilliant mix of satire, spoof and genuine action picture. The plot device, taking a group of actors and putting them in a situation where the movie they're making turns real, is brilliant because it allows the film to first poke fun at the artificiality of Hollywood, and then turn around and celebrate it when the action becomes "real".

The last film to try this was Last Action Hero (1993), which failed, ultimately, because it took itself too seriously. _Tropic Thunder_ doesn't make that mistake. It maintains a constant satirical sense of humor without ever veering into over-the-top spoof.

As good as the script is though, the performers are even better. Stiller is perfect as a fading action star, and Jack Black is fun as a Belushi-esque comedian, but Robert Downey Jr. steals the entire film as a renowned method actor so dedicated, he underwent a pigmentation process to play an African-American soldier. It's a brilliant satire, not only of the parts typically given to black actors in action pictures (especially the 70's), but also of racial perceptions and stereotypes.

Downey Jr.'s performance alone would be worth the price of admission, but combined a dynamite supporting cast and a wickedly sharp script, it makes _Tropic Thunder_ a must-see.

A young couple on the run to California encounter strange characters.

This movie isn't for everyone. It features quite a bit of disturbing imagery, some graphic violence, and a general vibe that some would call "weird". If these things don't appeal to you, stay away from this movie. If they do, then you'll probably love it.

I'm somewhere in the middle. The movie has moments of brilliance, Nicholas Cage and Willem Dafoe deliver knock-out performances, and director David Lynch's visual allegory to <span data-imdb-id="tt0032138">_The Wizard of Oz_</span> is inspired.

However, Lynch also lets too many scenes run long, and seems to indulge his taste in the bizarre at the expense of the pacing. Granted, he's definitely more disciplined here than on the similar <span data-imdb-id="tt0166924">_Mullhollland Drive_</span> but there's still room for improvement.

While investigating a blackmail case, a private investigator finds pornography and murder.

_The Big Sleep_'s director, Michael Winner--who also adapted the screenplay--seems to have had good intentions. Unfortunately, he was totally misguided.

Visually, the movie alternates between stylish noir and made-for-TV movie, a fault that must be attributed to director Winner, who can't seem to find his visual voice. This unevenness carries over to almost all aspects of the production.

The script, while much more faithful to Chandler's novel than <span data-imdb-id="tt0038355">the 1946 adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart</span>, inexplicably transplants the story to London, which is a critical mistake, as Los Angeles was as much a central character in Chandler's work as his detective, Philip Marlowe. The script also carries over a lot of voice-over narration from the novel which, while it's great writing, never works well in film and should have been dropped.

The casting is also uneven. First, the lead character of Philip Marlowe is played by Robert Mitchum. Mitchum was 60 years old when The Big Sleep was filmed and is much to old for the character. While he would have been perfect 20-25 years earlier, here he looks tired and pudgy and would have been a much better choice for the role of General Sternwood, who was instead played by Jimmy Stewart--another example of miscasting.

The character of General Sternwood is that of an old man who's life of excess has finally caught up with him. Believing that Jimmy Stewart, a man who positively radiates wholesomeness, lead a life of wild excess is just too much to ask of any audience.

Two of Winner's casting choices do work though, and very well at that. Oliver Reed is perfect as Eddie Mars, and Richard Boone works well as Canino. These two help salvage the second half of the film, and leave you wishing the rest of the casting were as good.

If you want a better story, read the Chandler novel. If you want a better movie, watch the 1946 Bogart version. Either way, forget this travesty.

After his father's death, a fast-talking salesman discovers the Autistic brother he never knew he had.

_Rain Man_ suffers from an interesting dilemma: it doesn't age particularly well due to its own success.

When _Rain Man_ was released in 1988 Autism was a relatively unknown disorder, but that quickly changed as a result of the movie's success. Almost overnight, every magazine was writing about Autism, and numerous segments were airing on nightly news programs. Since then there have been countless more articles and specials many featuring clips of Dustin Hoffman's _Rain Man_ performance. The end result is that the amount of time _Rain Man_ spends introducing the viewer to Autism seems redundant now that the disorder is so widely known.

_Rain Man_'s only other real problem also relates to age: From the opening shot on, director Barry Levinson firmly plants the movie in the 80s, yet Tom Cruise's character is an archetype and chaining him to a particular decade short-changes the timelessness of the narrative. While _Rain Man_ does work somewhat as a social commentary on the greed that pervaded the 1980s, the smaller, more personal story of Cruise's character's gradual maturity is the movie's real strength.

Those problems aside, _Rain Man_ is worth watching if only for Dustin Hoffman's much-imitated performance, which is truly amazing.

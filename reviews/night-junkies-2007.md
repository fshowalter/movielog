In London, two vampires attempt break their addiction to blood by going cold turkey.

_Night Junkies_ is another entry based around the vampirism as addiction metaphor. Previous (and more successful) films in this vein include Larry Fessenden’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0113241">_Habit_</span>, and Abel Ferrara’s aptly titled <span data-imdb-id="tt0112288">_The Addiction_</span>. Unfortunately, writer/director Lawrence Pearce’s attempt fails as both a film about addiction, and a film about vampires.

As a film about addiction, _Night Junkies_ is much too pretty. The lead, played by Giles Alderson is much too clean cut, with gelled hair and put-together outfits, to be a believable junkie. There’s no glimmer of desperation in his eyes, or hint of paranoia. Further, aside from what looks like a bad hangover, Pearce fails to give the viewer any sense of what real withdrawal feels like. In the post <span data-imdb-id="tt0117951">_Trainspotting_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0180093">_Requiem for a Dream_</span> world, _Night Junkies_ just doesn’t cut it.

As a vampire movie, _Night Junkies_ fails too. In playing up his addiction metaphor, Pearce drops perhaps the most important part of the vampire mythos, eternal life. Without it, the characters are more leeches than vampires.

_Night Junkies_ is Pearce’s first film, and it shows. While he seems to have a knack for eliciting good performances (the acting is surprisingly good), he relies too much on exposition, with his characters telling a lot of things he should be _showing_.

In the end, some good performances can’t compensate for a weak script and novice director.

A case of mistaken identity puts a slacker (Jeff Bridges) in the middle of a kidnapping case involving a millionaire’s wife.

_The Big Lebowski_ is the Coen Brothers' quasi-remake of Howard Hawk’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0038355">_The Big Sleep_</span>. Only, instead of a hard-boiled Humphrey Bogart, we’ve got a slacker named “The Dude,” portrayed perfectly by Jeff Bridges.

But the story is little more than an excuse to deconstruct the hard-boiled detective, much like Robert Altman did in <span data-imdb-id="tt0070334">_The Long Goodbye_</span>, only with even more irreverence.

The supporting cast is great, and the film is littered with so many in-jokes and self-references that you’re sure to find something new with every viewing. Unfortunately this self-reference is one of _The Big Lebowski_’s few flaws, as it keeps the film from being as accessible as it could be. _The Big Lebowski_ has a learning curve that can be steep.

That said, while some will no doubt be turned off by the language or lazy plot, if you look deeper there’s a real gem here.

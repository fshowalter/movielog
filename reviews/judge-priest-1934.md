A folksy judge (Will Rogers) outwits his rivals in a small southern town.

_Judge Priest_ is somewhat similar to star Will Rogers and director John Ford’s previous pairing, <span data-imdb-id="tt0023955">_Doctor Bull_</span>. Again, Rogers plays a folksy professional facing upheaval within a small town, but _Judge Priest_ is much lighter in tone than _Doctor Bull_, and, as such, works better.

Will Rogers is perfect as the titular character, and his natural charm carries the film well. The supporting cast is a mixed bag though, as Tom Brown is a little stiff as Rogers’ character’s nephew, though Berton Churchill and Henry B. Walthall are excellent as Rogers’ character’s chief rival and the town Reverend respectively.

Director Ford once again does a great job capturing the atmosphere of a small town, and stages some impressive shots given the technical limitations of the budget and times, but, like _Doctor Bull_, _Judge Priest_ is ultimately light on story, and feels a little long, even at only 80 minutes.

Still, _Judge Priest_ is worth a look for fans of Will Rogers or those curious about director John Ford’s early career. Others needn’t bother.

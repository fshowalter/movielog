An Irishman (Peter McDonald) fresh out of prison is forced by a gangster (Tony Doyle) to help a thug (Brendan Gleeson) track down a man (Peter Caffrey).

_I Went Down_ is an enjoyable British crime yarn. The performances are all great and go a long way to making the movie as enjoyable as it is. The fact that Peter McDonald looks like the Irish Ed Norton doesn't hurt matters either.

The real strength here though is the script. It weaves through several twists and turns before coming to an abrupt--but not unsatisfying--conclusion, all the while sporting funny, insightful and sometimes touching dialog.

Sure the movie has problems. Chief among them are continuity errors you could drive a truck through, such as McDonald's pants looking remarkably clean right after he falls in a bog. Still, the script is so good it's easy to overlook things like this.

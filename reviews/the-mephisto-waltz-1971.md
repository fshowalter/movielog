A dying pianist makes a deal with the devil to possess the body of a younger man.

_The Mephisto Waltz_ has one thing going for it: Jacqueline Bisset. She's gorgeous and when she's on screen you don't mind the plodding story and you overlook the gaping plot holes. When she's not on screen however, these faults become very apparent.

The rest of the cast does a decent, if unremarkable job. Curd JÃ¼rgens is enjoyable as the satanic pianist, and Alan Alda tries very hard to make us believe Jacqueline Bisset could be married to him.

Until the finale, which is right out of left-field ala _Tales From the Crypt_, the script is predictable with no real suspense or surprises. The real problem however, is that there's only 45 minutes of story here, but _The Mephisto Waltz_ runs more than twice that length.

The direction is adequate, with decent atmospherics, but on the whole, the production never seems to rise above T.V.-movie status.

With a shorter running time, this would have made a great _Tales From the Crypt_ episode, but as it stands _The Mephisto Waltz_ is quite forgettable.

A wheelchair-bound woman (Susan Strasberg) doubts her sanity after repeatedly seeing her absent father's corpse around his French Riviera home.

_Taste of Fear_ (_Scream of Fear_ in the US) is an oft-overlooked gem in the Hammer library.

Jimmy Sangster’s script is a mix of suspense, mystery, horror and film noir that blends well. Further, Sangster anticipates cynical audiences by having his characters quickly acknowledge the cliché plot-points, thus giving the story an air of freshness. Sure, there are some holes, but they're reasonably easy to overlook, and Sangster more than makes up for them by delivering a knockout third act.

Director Seth Holt makes the most of his limited budget, and avoids the stagy feel that permeated so many Hammer productions by setting a good number of scenes outdoors. Additionally he coaxes a great performance out of Susan Strasberg and wisely regulates Christopher Lee's ridiculous French accent to the background.

_Taste of Fear_'s only flaw is its pacing. The script spends a lot of its first act building atmosphere when it should be moving the story along, and as a result, the audience gets ahead of the characters regarding some plot points. It's not until midway through the second act, when the characters finally catch up with — and overtake — the audience, that the movie really takes off, but once it does it doesn't disappoint.

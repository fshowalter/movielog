_Destination Tokyo_ is reminiscent of Warner Brothers' <span data-imdb-id="tt0035608">_Action in the North Atlantic_</span> which came out earlier the same year. Both were even nominated for the best original story Academy Award, though Tokyo is the weaker of the two.

Set during World War II, this entry sees submarine captain Cary Grant's mission complicated by Japanese fighters, depth charges, and a crewman's appendectomy.

Despite his urbane manner being ill suited to military films, Grant does a fine job carrying the picture. Here, he's the ideal captain, weathering storm after storm, be it Japanese bombers, depth charges, or even a crewman's rush appendectomy, Grant's character is unflappable, with nary a hair out of place.

The supporting players are solid, with some of the cast of _Action in the North Atlantic_ playing nearly identical roles in this film. John Forsythe even makes his first credited appearance in a small part. Unfortunately, unlike _Action_, _Tokyo_ doesn't work as well as an ensemble film, and drags whenever Grant isn't on screen. Further, the script is quite preachy, with several characters delivering propaganda-laced monologues about the evils of the Japs, which only serve to further drag down the story.

Ultimately, fans of war pictures, or of Grant, will find _Destination Tokyo_ worth a look, but others would be better off watching the grittier, superior, _Action in the North Atlantic_.

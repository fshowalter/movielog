In 1831 Australia, ex-convict turned wealthy and powerful businessman Sam Flusky, played by Cotten, befriends fresh-off-the-boat and looking to make his fortune Charles Adare, played by Wilding. Wilding soon falls for Cotten's alcoholic wife, played by Bergman, and sets about rebuilding her self-esteem. But the Flusky house has secrets that, when revealed, cast a new light on everything.

Solid performances and Hitchcock's use of the long takes he experimented with in <span data-imdb-id="tt0040746">_Rope_</span> can't overcome a talky, dull script that feels like a less interesting retread of <span data-imdb-id="tt0032976">_Rebecca_</span>, minus the gothic overtones. A somewhat forgotten entry in the Hitchcock oeuvre, _Under Capricorn_ should probably stay that way.

A spoof of spy movies, Elvis movies, and even <span data-imdb-id="tt0080453">_The Blue Lagoon_</span>.

_Top Secret_ is disappointing. After the inspired comedy of <span data-imdb-id="tt0080339">_Airplane_</span>, the creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker seem to have gone for quantity over quality. In _Top Secret_ they cram in as many gags as possible, with a gag in almost every shot. Unfortunately this leaves little time for any set up or misdirection, thus most of the gags are obvious and feel forced.

_Top Secret_'s other problem is in it's cast. Val Kilmer is a great actor, but doesn't do comedy well, and while some of the supporting cast--especially Omar Sherif--are entertaining, many--like Peter Cushing and Michael Gough--are simply wasted.

A small station of goof-off Vermont state troopers try to save their jobs by outwitting the local police department. Broken Lizard's first film may take a viewing or two to warm up to, but the quirky characters and off-beat bits quickly grow on you. Granted, not every bit is laugh-out-loud funny, but there's a real charm here that holds up well to repeat viewings.

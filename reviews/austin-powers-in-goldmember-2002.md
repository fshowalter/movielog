International Man of Mystery Austin Powers (Mike Myers) must rescue his father (Michael Caine) from his nemesis Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and a gold-obsessed madman (Mike Myers).

_Austin Powers in Goldmember_ is the third entry in the <span data-imdb-id="tt0118655">_Austin Powers_</span> franchise following <span data-imdb-id="tt0145660">_Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me_</span>.

The script, by Myers and Michael McCullers reuses many of the gags from the first two films, but also works in enough original material to keep things fresh. The series, however, is dangerously close to becoming a parody of itself, as evidenced by the parade of celebrity guests parodying the movie's main characters.

_Goldmember_'s strongest suit is the addition of Michael Caine as Austin Powers's father. Stealing all of his scenes, Caine ambles through the film with the same easy charm he's been perfecting his whole career, and thus seems perfectly suited as Myer's father. Also stealing his share of scenes is Seth Green, whose closing bit is an instant classic.

Another addition is the titular character Goldmember. While the character lacks the audacity of Fat Bastard, he does work exceptionally well as a foil for the other characters, and his interactions with Dr. Evil are priceless.

But as the franchise goes, _Goldmember_ is the weakest entry. The script's first draft was started in March of 2001, and the completed film was released on July 22 of the following year. This schedule couldn't have allowed for many rewrites which ultimately keep the movie from feeling as polished as the previous two films; something a revision or two could have prevented.

Let's get it out of the way, Johnny Depp walks away with this movie. His performance is alone is worth your eight dollars.

The other real star is the score, which is easily the best of the summer.

Unfortunately this movie runs about two hours and 15 minutes, which is about a half an hour too long. The story goes from point-A to point-B to point-C, only to go back to point-B and then back to point-C yet again. The five act structure being adopted by many movies these days is becoming tiresome, as more often than not, it reduces the third act to a bridge, rather than the climax it should be.

That said, you'll enjoy the ride even if the ending feels a little long in coming.

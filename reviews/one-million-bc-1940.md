Banished from his warlike, meat-eating, Rock tribe, a caveman discovers the peaceful, vegetable-eating, Shell tribe, and a woman.

That’s a hell of a synopsis, isn’t it?

There’s a reason you don’t see many cavemen movies: cavemen don’t speak. Sure, they grunt and point, but for all intents and purposes, _One Million B.C._ is a silent picture. This really isn’t a problem though, as dialog couldn’t possibly help. For the first twenty minutes or so, my finger hovered over the fast-forward button, but once I got used to the acting and Hollywood production (Carole Landis’s cavewoman wears make-up), I couldn’t quite bring myself to turn off the movie.

With the right attitude, _One Million B.C._ is quite enjoyable. The special effects veer between silly and inspired, but they’re always entertaining. Combined with the preposterous acting and quick 80-minute running time, they help make this a classic so-bad-it’s-good movie. By the time the finale rolled around featuring the cave people facing off against a giant iguana, I was laughing out loud.

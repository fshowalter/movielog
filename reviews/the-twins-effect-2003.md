Okay, honestly I'm not sure what this is about exactly because I had to fast-forward through so much of it, but basically these two girls have to fight some vampires.

_The Twins Effect_, or _The Vampire Effect_ as it's being called on cable, starts off with one of the most spectacular vampire fight scenes I've ever seen. Forget <span data-imdb-id="tt0120611">_Blade_</span> or <span data-imdb-id="tt0320691">_Underworld_</span>, this was like watching a living cartoon, and it was awesome. Unfortunately things start going progressively downhill from there.

Shortly after this scene the movie drastically shifts gears and morphs into a teen-romance comedy. We're introduced to two teenage girls who proceed to dominate the screen for the rest of the movie which now revolves around one of the girls falling in love with a young vampire prince.

I've come to find out that the girls are huge pop-stars in Hong Kong, so this was obviously intended as a vehicle for them, but after ten minutes of them on the screen my finger was on the fast-forward button.

Fast-forwarding through the teen comedy, the occasional fight scenes were still enjoyable and well choreographed. I should also point out that this was a dubbed version, which couldn't help matters, but even still, these girls don't have half the charisma of Ekin Cheng, who is unfortunately reduced to a supporting role. Jackie Chan also makes an appearance, but even he can't save this mess.

There's about 15 minutes of good to great footage here, just fast-forward through the rest. If you're not a fan of Vampire Kung Fu movies forget it entirely.

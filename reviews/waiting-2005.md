The employees of a chain restaurant ponder their lives and their futures.

_Waiting_ is a frustrating movie. In front of the camera you have a great cast, but they’re working with a script by writer/director Rob McKittrick that just isn’t funny. That the movie is even watchable is a testament to the charisma of the cast, particularly Ryan Reynolds who has a real gift for comedic timing, but can’t seem to catch a break script-wise.

In many ways, _Waiting_ is a movie begging to be written by Kevin Smith. In fact, he did write it a couple of years later as <span data-imdb-id="tt0424345">_Clerks II_</span>. Watch that instead.

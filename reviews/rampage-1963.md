Trapper Mitchum accompanies hunter Hawkins on safari in search of a rare leopard, but things get complicated when Mitchum makes a play for Hawkins's mistress, played by Martinelli.

Hawaii looks great doubling for Malaysia, and the film wouldn't have been half bad if it had stayed there, but instead the action shifts to a train and then rooftops of Munich, getting more and more ridiculous along the way. Just turn it off after they capture the leopard and move on.

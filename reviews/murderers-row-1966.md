Dino's back as Matt Helm, this time thwarting a BIG-O plot involving a Helio-Beam.

He's got a nicer car, a better co-star in Ann-Margret, and a bigger budget as evidenced by the Monaco location shooting, but this second entry in the Matt Helm series lacks much of the quirky charm that made the first, <span data-imdb-id="tt0060980">_The Silencers_</span>, something of a guilty pleasure.

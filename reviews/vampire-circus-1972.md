Fifteen years after destroying the vampire preying on them, the residents of a small eastern European village find themselves quarantined and besieged by a mysterious plague. When a gypsy circus arrives, the residents are excited, but their excitement soon turns to fear as the circus proves to be more than it seems.

Good production and fun performances make the most of a creative script that manages some creepy thrills without taking itself too seriously. The liberal dashes of sex and blood don't hurt either.

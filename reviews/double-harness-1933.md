A woman (Ann Harding) tricks her playboy husband (William Powell) into marriage, then tries to make him really love her.

_Double Harness_ is an enjoyable enough comedy drama, buoyed by a strong performance from William Powell, and a workable supporting cast.

Powell is a joy to watch as he carries the film with his polished urbane charm. Here, he's just one year removed from the one-two punch of <span data-imdb-id="tt0025464">_Manhattan Melodrama_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0025878">_The Thin Man_</span>, that would cement his star status, and it shows.

Opposite him, top-billed Ann Harding is fine, giving a remarkably subdued and understated performance. While she may lack the innate charm of Powell's most memorable co-star, Myrna Loy, she acquits herself well.

The supporting cast is solid too, particularly Henry Stephenson as Harding's character's father, and Lucile Brown as her sister.

At only 69 minutes, _Double Harness_ is efficient, cramming a good bit of story and characterization into the shortest possible timeframe, which goes a long way toward making the whole experience a pleasant, if unremarkable, one.

Most importantly, the film holds your interest, and even though it isn't particularly funny, or emotionally moving, it is very easy to sit through, while cracking the occasional smirk or chuckle, and definitely worth a look for Powell fans.

Surprisingly unfunny remake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0029284">_My Favorite Wife_</span> with Day in the Irene Dunne role and Garner in the Cary Grant role.

Despite the cast's innate charisma, all the characters are pretty unlikable and the Randolph Scott character (played by Chuck Connors) doesn't even show up until the film's more than half over. The film's only laughs come at the end, when Edgar Buchanan (who seems to have made a career out of playing judges) gets to tell everyone to shut up. Watch the original instead.

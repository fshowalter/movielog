_Gunga Din_ is an entertaining adventure picture.

It starts with a classic opening credit sequence and closes with a knock-out action sequence that holds up well to this day. The leads are fun to watch, and the film ages well.

The story sees Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as British troops battling a Thuggee cult with the help of a native water carrier.

Granted, the score can be overpowering, with musical ques inserted where silence would have much better served the atmosphere, and the script does drag a bit towards the middle. While neither of these are deal-breakers, I can't help but wonder if Howard Hawks--who was scheduled to direct the movie before being fired--would have made the same mistakes.

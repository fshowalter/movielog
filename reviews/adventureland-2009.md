A recent college graduate (Jesse Eisenberg) desperate to escape his small town for New York City, finds himself forced to take a job at a local amusement park.

_Adventureland_ is a time machine. Not only to the late 80s era in which it's set, but also to that early 20's point in your life, when you're an adult but not really a grown-up and your whole life is stretched out before you. It's an intangible quality, but writer/director Greg Mottola's film somehow bottles it.

Of course, it helps that his cast is fantastic. Jesse Eisenberg great as the lead; not too glamorous to be unbelievable, and not too awkward to be unlikable. Opposite him, Kristen Stewart shows she's capable of rising to quality material.

Supporting them, Bill Hader gets the most laughs as an amusement park manager, and Ryan Reynolds, playing against type, gives the performance of his career. His last scene alone, where he manages to convey volumes of emotion in a single, knowing look, proves he's much more than a one-trick, romantic comedy, pony.

_Adventureland_ is a hard movie not to like. The plot is organic and engaging, the dialog is believable, the atmosphere is spot-on, and the performers are all charismatic. All of which adds up to an easy recommendation for the best movie of the year, so far.

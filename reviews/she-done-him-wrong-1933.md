_She Done Him Wrong_ is the film adaptation of Mae West’s play _Diamond Lil_.

The plot sees West play a saloon owner juggling a slew of men including a missionary played by Cary Grant.

While _She Done Him Wrong_ was no doubt scandalous in 1933, it’s tame by today’s standards. In the post-feminist era, the idea of a sexually liberated woman is no longer shocking. Indeed, looking through a modern eye, the supposed chemistry between West and Grant is hardly believable.

That aside, the script does move well, especially in the film’s last 20 minutes, and the 66-minute running time keeps things from getting too stale. Further, there’s a solid performance from Grant, even though he looks oddly lanky in that black missionary costume.

The discovery of a strange prehistoric skull in the English countryside leads a Lord (Hugh Grant) and an archeologist to an ancient snake-worshipping cult.

_The Lair of the White Worm_ could almost pass for a modern day Hammer Film production. From the blood red opening credits, to the over the top violence and nudity, you almost expect Christopher Lee to pop up at any moment.

Unfortunately, Lee is nowhere to be found, but the leads are still great. Hugh Grant shows much of the charisma that would later make him a star, and Amanda Donohoe is suitably vampy as Grant’s character’s mysterious neighbor.

The supporting cast isn’t as solid. While Peter Capaldi is fun as an archeology student, and Paul Brooke turns in a very memorable policeman, Catherine Oxenberg and Sammi Davis seem far too wooden. Their performances are the weak links in an otherwise solid chain.

The script by Russell from Bram Stoker’s novel is a wonderful mix of black comedy, camp, and horror. Russell moves the plot along at a terrific pace while keeping his tongue firmly planted in his cheek.

Uneven cast aside, Russell’s film is one that Hammer Film fans, as well as fans of British Horror would do well to check it out.

In London, a man (Jon Finch) finds himself suspected of being a serial killer who strangles his victims with a necktie.

_Frenzy_ was famed director Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film, and it's one of his best.

The screenplay by Anthony Shaffer is a taunt mix of thrills and black humor, and the perfect material for Hitchcock who, in keeping with the script's darker tone eschews the gloss and polish that permeated his earlier thriller and instead turns in a gritty, urban shocker.

This was also Hitchcock's first picture to feature nudity and the he seems to enjoy the exploitative aspect, throwing in several breast shots that further distance the film from Hitchcock's older, tamer, work.

If _Frenzy_ has a flaw, it's in the score by Ron Goodwin, which can be a little overpowering early on. Granted, it's spot-on at points, but those early moments when it's distracting are the film's only missteps. Interestingly, Henry Mancini originally scored the film, but was fired by Hitchcock as his work sounded too similar to Hitchcock's longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann.

That said, after two underwhelming films, <span data-imdb-id="tt0061107">_Torn Curtain_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0065112">_Topaz_</span>, _Frenzy_ marked a welcome return to form for the Master of Suspense, and proof that, even at 73 years of age, Hitchcock definitely still "had it."

A psychologist (Noel Coward) begins an affair with his wife's best friend, which ultimately destroys his marriage.

_The Astonished Heart_ works largely due to star Noel Coward's script. Despite being over half a century old, it remains resonant today, largely due to the fact that Coward refuses to judge any of his characters, and instead plays the narrative relatively straight, casting his characters as victims of their own circumstances. It's a refreshing change from the usually moralistic melodramas of the time, and a testament to Coward's enduring popularity as a playwright. Directors Antony Darnborough and Terence Fisher (later of Hammer fame) take a similarly restrained approach that suits the story well.

Unfortunately, Coward the actor leaves a little more to be desired. He replaced Michael Redgrave during filming, and does a suitable job, though the part would have been perfect for George Sanders. Granted, at the time, Sanders was seven years younger than Coward, but with the right makeup and wardrobe he could have pulled it off.

That aside, _The Astonished Heart_ probably won't appeal to everyone. The characters are all very English and some might consider the film stuffy, but fans of Coward's work should find it enjoyable enough.

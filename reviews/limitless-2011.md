Cooper plays a writer who can't get his life together until he discovers an underground drug that turns him into a mental superman. Soon, he's jetting around the world and helping Wall Street tycoon De Niro navigate billion dollar deals. Then the side effects start catching up with him.

It's a great premise, one that has the potential for a great movie, but the script falls short, devolving into a routine thriller during the second act, before redeeming itself somewhat in the finale. As for the cast, though he's not quite believable early on, Cooper shines once the plot kicks in, and while De Niro's just cashing a paycheck, he gives an honest day's work. There are a lot of missed opportunities here (as well as a few dangling plot-points) but it's still a fun ride.

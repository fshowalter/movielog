A brutal murder unravels lifelong family secrets in a small California town.

_Homicidal_, while a derivative of Hitchcock’s Psycho, holds up well enough on its own merits.

After a charming little introduction by director William Castle, _Homicidal_ starts with a bang and never really lets up. Castle compensates for the unevenness of his cast by creating a deeply disturbing atmosphere that keeps the audience on edge.

Unfortunately, _Homicidal_ has two problems. The first is that, due to budgetary reasons, many viewers will likely guess the finale’s big twist long before it’s unveiling. Castle does some nice slight of hand, but he’s ultimately undone by his own limitations.

The second problem is Castle’s use of the “Fright Break” gimmick. Granted, he’d become known for these sorts of things after such films as <span data-imdb-id="tt0053363">_The Tingler_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0051744">_House on Haunted Hill_</span>, but _Homicidal_ is a much darker picture than either of those, and the gimmick feels out of place here.

Still, minor flaws aside, _Homicidal_ is a pleasant surprise and worth a look, especially for genre fans.

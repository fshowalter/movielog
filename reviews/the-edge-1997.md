A billionaire (Anthony Hopkins) and a photographer (Alec Baldwin) battle the elements and a bear in the Alaskan wilderness.

_The Edge_ is writer David Mamet's homage to wilderness adventure movies. Here, he takes the genre's basic formula and plays with it, turning some conventions on their ears, while subtly poking fun at others; all the while sprinkling in liberal doses of his trademark snappy dialog.

For his part, director Lee Tamahori wisely plays the material with a straight face. While an argument could be made that the film could work with a more over-the-top approach, this would obscure Mamet's genuine love for the genre, as well as Donald McAlpine's great cinematography.

Casting is equally well done. Anthony Hopkins seems tailor-made for his part, as does Mamet-veteran Alec Baldwin. Indeed, depending on when Mamet originally wrote the script, he may have had both men in mind for the roles. About the only casting flub is giving Bart the Bear billing over L.Q. Jones. The bear's great, mind you, but L.Q.'s a lot more colorful and, at 70-years-old, has seniority.

In the end, viewers expecting another of Mamet's labyrinthine thrillers will be disappointed, but those going in with an open mind will find themselves treated to an above average wilderness adventure featuring a pair of solid performances and more than a few great lines.

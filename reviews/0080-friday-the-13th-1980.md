There's no hockey mask and no Jason. But _Friday the 13th_ birthed a franchise still kicking today.

<!-- end -->

The plot hews closer to a Giallo than a monster movie. An unknown killer picks of young people working to re-open a New Jersey summer camp. Though the script proffers some red-herrings, the ending proves a cheat.

Director Sean Cunningham's realistic style feeds our inner voyeur. We watch the young cast goof off, fool around, and bond. The dingy camp location evokes the right combination of authenticity and dissonance. Tom Savini's practical effects age well.

It's only in the third act that the film falters. Cunningham stretches the final-girl beyond her range. She over-emotes and the script seems out of ideas. She incapacitates the killer, only to drop her weapon and run to another hiding spot. Rinse and repeat.

The epilogue almost compensates. Dollars to doughnuts, it'll make you jump on your first watch.

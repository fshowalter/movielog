Rosaline Russell plays a writer who moves from small-town Ohio to New York’s Greenwich Village with her sister, an aspiring actress with a knack for attracting men.

_My Sister Eileen_ starts out well enough. Rosalind Russell’s character isn’t that far removed from her character in <span data-imdb-id="tt0032599">_His Girl Friday_</span>, so much so that this film could almost work as a prequel.

Unfortunately, as the movie wears on, the screwball-comedy begins to eclipse the story and the whole film suffers. This is due, in large part, to the fact that the screwball aspects are all built around a single joke, that of Janet Blair’s character being so irresistible to men.

Unfortunately, Blair herself pales next to Russell’s immense charm and presence, and so, the joke doesn’t really work. Further, the situations get more and more preposterous as the film rolls on, to the point where any suspension of disbelief is lost and the antics just feel forced.

Still, Russell is entertaining to watch and the 1940’s Greenwich Village atmosphere is terrific. Also, if you stick around to the very end there’s a nice surprise just before the credits roll.

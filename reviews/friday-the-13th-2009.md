Here's what you need to know about this 2009 remake: if Jason weren't wearing his hockey mask, you'd forget it by morning. As is, you'll forget it by the next afternoon.

The opening is efficient, at least. We get the Cliff's Notes version of  <span data-imdb-id="tt0080761">the original</span>: Jason's mom goes on a killing spree at Camp Crystal Lake in 1980, blaming counselors for her son's drowning. She loses her head. Literally. Then we jump to 2009, where Jason--now fully grown and very much alive--stalks two groups of kids. First, some twenty-somethings hunting for weed in the woods. Then, a different batch visiting a rich kid's lakeside cabin. Bodies pile up. Credits roll.

Strip away the iconography and what's left? Not much. This doesn't feel like a _Friday the 13th_ movie. It feels like someone's idea of what a _Friday the 13th_ movie should be in the age of <span data-imdb-id="tt0387564">_Saw_</span>.

The cast looks like they wandered off a CW soundstage. They're attractive. They're interchangeable. They have no personality beyond "stoner," "rich kid," and "good guy." Remember Shelly from <span data-imdb-id="tt0083972">_Part 3_</span>? Crispin Glover's jittery performance in <span data-imdb-id="tt0087298">_Part 4_</span>? Or Ginny, the resourceful final girl from <span data-imdb-id="tt0082418">_Part 2_</span>? This film offers none of that. Even our heroine barely registers.

Worse, Jason himself is all wrong. He's become a sadistic torturer, setting traps designed to maximize pain and terror. This is <span data-imdb-id="tt0844479">_The Collector_</span> territory--and that film, also from 2009, handles this material far better. 

The original Jason was brutal but simple. A killing machine with a child's mind. You never got the sense he needed to sleep or eat or do anything but wait. When he killed, he preferred up close--quick and brutal. This Jason? He's built an elaborate underground bunker with tunnels and escape routes. He shoots arrows through eyeballs from a football field away. He throws axes with perfect accuracy in the dark, uphill, at moving targets. 

Why? That's the question the film can't answer. At first he seems territorial--trespass and die. But then he attacks kids at a cabin that appears well-used and maintained. If it's been there for years (or was recently built), it must be outside his territory, right? The logic crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.

Even the setting betrays the franchise. Shot in Texas, it never convinces as New Jersey despite the desperate scattering of Garden State license plates.

The producers clearly wanted to "modernize" the series--grittier, more realistic, with torture-porn elements to compete with _Saw_--while still delivering fan-service callbacks. They succeeded at neither. 

This isn't what made _Friday the 13th_ work. The series never needed big budgets or name actors. It needed a good Jason (Kane Hodder proved the role isn't interchangeable), a location that passes for Jersey, and believable kids in their own teen movie. Then let Jason tear through that movie in brutal, creative ways.

This wasn't that movie.

Seventeen years later, we're still waiting.

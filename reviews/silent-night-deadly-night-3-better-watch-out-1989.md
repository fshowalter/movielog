This third entry in the Santa-slasher series loses the Santa costume but gains name recognition with director Monte Hellman and stars Bill Mosely and Robert Culp. The result? The franchise’s worst entry thus far.

I blame Hellman, as besides directing, he gets a co-story credit, and the film’s problems begin with the script.

After the events of part two, Ricky survived his apparent death thanks to some improbable surgery. He now lies comatose in a California hospital where smarmy doctor Newbury tries to leverage blind young Laura’s psychic ability to infiltrate Ricky’s slumbering conscious.

If this premise seems familiar, it’s because you’ve seen Friday the 13th part seven.

Anyway, Ricky soon wakes up and makes a beeline to Laura’s grandmother’s house to kill her. It’s not clear why, as the film goes through pains to present Ricky as a Frankenstein-like sympathetic villain, who’s killing rage only emerges when he sees the color red.

This because a red-clad Santa murdered his parents when he was an infant and he witnessed another red-clad Santa’s accidental shooting when he was a schoolboy.

We see both events via flashbacks to the first film, but we get no footage from the prior film, perhaps to avoid drawing attention to Ricky’s recasting. Eric Freeman and his animated eyebrows are out, replaced by Bill Moseley, who spends the film sporting what he refers to in an interview as a “blinking brain cap”, and which he describes as a “clear plastic salad bowl with blinking lights on the back, I guess in case I backed up or something.”

Mosely’s near-silent performance continues the Frankenstein motif, with his stilted gait and dead-eyed expression. He convinces as a tortured monster, but pathos isn’t what the film needs.

Indeed, it needs action. The film lumbers from one dialogue-heavy scene to another. The performers lack the charisma to elevate the material. As Laura, first timer X doesn’t convince as blind, rendering her entire performance artificial. Eric DaRe, son of Aldo Ray, plays her brother, and also struggles with the talky script.

Their relative lack of experience becomes clear with Robert Culp’s arrival midway through playing a detective following Ricky’s murderous trail. The lone beacon of charisma, Culp can and does make a scene extolling the virtues of car phones tolerable.

Yes, we get a dark scene of Culp and Doctor Newbury driving up a freeway with Culp trying to sell Newbury on the merits of the car phone. “You get call registry, call waiting, call forwarding, hundred memory auto dialer,” he says.

Hellman should know better. He came up through Roger Coreman’s production company. An exploitation picture needs action. Hellman’s film offers little. Most of Ricky’s murders occur off screen. Instead of set piece kills, the film cuts to gruesome footage of the mutilated victims. The time these set pieces could have filled instead goes to scenes of characters talking in cars driving up California freeways at night. These generic settings—dark cars, white hallways, and generic basements—rob the film of the atmospheric verisimilitude of its predecessors.

This results in tedious pacing as we wait for something—anything—to happen. This prolonged waiting drains the film of any tension.

Worst of all, when we Ricky the finale arrives, it underwhelms. Consider the Ricky’s first attack scene.

Laura, her brother Chris, and her brother’s girlfriend Jerri are inside a farmhouse. Jerri stands by the door. Ricky’s arms burst through the door and grab Jerri, choking her. “Oh, shit,” says Chris, as though someone just spilled wine on a new couch. Chris runs off screen. Jerri struggles. Blind Laura does nothing. There’s no score. Just dead air and a stagnant medium shot. Chris returns with a small knife, stabs Ricky through the arm, then runs off screen again. More dead-air silence as Ricky releases Jerri, who drops to the floor. Ricky retreats. A beat or two passes, then Chris comes back and asks Jerri if she’s okay.

Such awkward pacing and stilted editing evoke an amateur production, and pale next to any scene in the prior films, which—for all their faults—were never boring.

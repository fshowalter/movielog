---

Despite featuring memorable characters, great performances, and an immersive atmosphere, _Murder by Decree_ proves frustrating thanks to a fundamentally flawed script that shoehorns Sherlock Holmes into a '70s conspiracy thriller.

The story sees Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson investigating the Whitechapel murders of Jack the Ripper, leading Holmes to uncover a vast conspiracy.

A great premise, but the script by John Hopkins sees an uncharacteristically emotional Holmes dip into bouts of teary-eyed melodrama and suffer from a convenient glass jaw, falling unconscious whenever the plot requires it. Worse still, Holmes does little detecting. Instead he relies on a psychic, played with verve by Donald Sutherland, to all but name the perpetrator. Hopkins also plays unfair with the audience, withholding details until the finale when Holmes reveals them in a long-winded melodramatic speech backed by weepy music. At least the dialogue feels period-appropriate without resorting to archaic phrasing.

The Holmes characterization trouble traces back to Hopkins basing his screenplay on Stephen Knight’s then-popular book, _Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution_. Shoehorning in Knight’s elaborate conspiracy theory requires scenes that only serve to introduce the culprit (sharp viewers will suss out the killer’s identity long before Holmes, leaving the mystery not _who_ but _why_), though Hopkins doesn’t help by telegraphing other bits (the film features what can best be described as "Chekov’s scarf") and the aforementioned convenient bouts of unconsciousness.

A shame, as Plummer shines in the role, delivering what the script asks while hinting how he could have played a more accurate Holmes. Alongside him, Mason is even better, turning in perhaps the best Watson on film at that point.

Where prior films reduced Watson to a bumbling audience surrogate, the film’s more emotional Holmes allows Mason's Watson to function closer to a peer of Holmes--a refreshing change--though the film can’t resist presenting the pair as an old married couple, as best illustrated during a dinner scene when an agitated Holmes mashes Watson’s last pea, leading Watson to pout.

Director Bob Clark, just one film removed from <span data-imdb-id="tt0071222">_Black Christmas_</span>, once again shows his gift for crafting immersive atmospheres. Like the house in _Black Christmas_, Clark's interiors all feel lived-in and authentic, but this film's bigger budget allows him to extend his touch to exteriors too, and his London is a fog-shrouded labyrinth of cobblestone streets that fits the story’s thriller nature. Also like _Black Christmas_, he stages the Ripper scenes with an effective POV style, though this film’s PG rating keeps the violence largely off-screen.

But ultimately, despite the production and performances, _Murder by Decree_ disappoints. While the idea of marrying a Holmes mystery to a '70s conspiracy thriller may seem appealing, the genres prove incompatible. Having Holmes uncover a conspiracy is fine, but he’d do so through logic and deduction, not psychics, and his conclusions wouldn’t require the script to magically produce non-existent evidence at the last minute to substantiate them. Frustrating, as Plummer and Mason made a great team. Seeing them in a real Holmes mystery would have been a treat.

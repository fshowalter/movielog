An Edinburgh youth (Ewan McGregor) tries to break free of the heroin addiction and friends (Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller) holding him back.

_Trainspotting_ is, at times, laugh out loud funny and, at other times, deeply disturbing. Often, it's both. Director Danny Boyle's film, based on Irvine Welsh's novel, is a visual and aural tour-de-force that immerses the viewer in the heroin-fueled world of Scotland's drug subculture, offering a raw, impartial look at the life and its consequences, all set to a throbbing, iconic soundtrack. It doesn't glamorize its characters or their lifestyle, but it doesn't crucify them either.

Instead, it's a wild ride, full of razor-sharp dialog, honest performances, and more than a few moments of tear-inducing humor. Best of all, the film feels honest, unlike Boyle's later, but similar, <span data-imdb-id="tt1010048">_Slumdog Millionaire_</span>, as it doesn't rely on a fairy-tale conceit to hold up its story. Granted, it's that very same honesty that makes _Trainspotting_ less accessible, as its darker elements can be very disturbing, and the ending, while satisfying, is far from life-affirming.

But it's that honesty that makes the film so resonant. Some films gently move you and some films knock you on your ass. _Trainspotting_ definitely falls into the latter category, but once you get past the shock, you'll find a biting look at society that holds up perfectly well 13 years later and one that's highly recommended.

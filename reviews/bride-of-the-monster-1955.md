A scientist (Bela Lugosi) plans to create a superhuman army using atomic energy.

Let’s get this out of the way: _Bride of the Monster_ isn’t a good movie. It’s got stilted acting, some laughable special effects, and plot holes galore. Despite these shortcomings, it’s not a bad movie either. It’s an Ed Wood movie.

Director, producer, and co-writer Edward D. Wood Jr. loved his job, and that’s what makes his films so damn entertaining, despite their shortcomings. He wasn’t just a company hack cashing a paycheck, he genuinely cared about his films and performers, and it shows on screen.

That said, _Bride of the Monster_ does feature a very entertaining Bela Lugosi performance and some good atmosphere. Topped off with the giant Tor Johnson and you’ve got a fun, campy, ride that really _tries_ to entertain, and that enthusiasm is contagious.

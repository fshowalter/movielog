Three escaped convicts (Humphrey Bogart, Dewey Martin, and Robert Middleton) terrorize a suburban family.

_The Desperate Hours_ was Humphrey Bogart’s penultimate film, in many ways bringing him full circle, echoing back to his breakout role in <span data-imdb-id="tt0028096">_The Petrified Forest_</span> almost twenty years prior. Bogart brings an intense ferocity to the role, exuding a simmering rage that seems to seep out of his every word and action. Where a lesser actor would have over played the part, Bogart nails it perfectly.

Opposite Bogie, Fredric March does an equally admirable job. Perhaps inspired by Bogart (or maybe vice-versa), March too plays his part believably low-key. These two anchor the film and are a joy to watch.

The script by Joseph Hayes does a great job of slowly ratcheting up the tension, and is packed with great dialog. Its only real flaw is the Ralphie Hilliard character. He’s a little brat that only serves as a plot device and acts as a speed bump in an otherwise brilliant story.

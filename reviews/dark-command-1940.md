A cowboy (John Wayne) arrives in Kansas, runs for Marshal, and battles a Confederate raider.

_Dark Command_ was one of Republic Pictures’ first big budget westerns. With the success of <span data-imdb-id="tt0031971">_Stagecoach_</span> the year prior, John Wayne had proven himself an A-List box office draw and Republic sought to capitalize. While the result is not wholly removed from his earlier B-westerns, it is an improvement.

The story is nothing new. John Wayne arrives in town, sniffs out trouble, and sets about making things right. What is new, however, is the bigger budget, which translates to better production values and a superior supporting cast. George ‘Gabby’ Hayes, the best regular in Wayne’s B-westerns, is joined by Claire Trevor, Roy Rogers, and Walter Pidgeon, who finally provides the Duke with a villain that’s more than a cardboard cutout.

Director Raoul Walsh (who had given the Duke his first big break ten years earlier in <span data-imdb-id="tt0020691">_The Big Trail_</span>) does a good job with the action, although his decision to downplay the sensational stunt work of Yakima Canutt is a detriment.

At 94 minutes, _Dark Command_ runs quite a bit longer than most of Wayne's B-westerns. While this does allow the film to flesh out several of its characters, it also loses some of the raw efficiency of those earlier entries. Fans of Wayne should enjoy it, but those looking for another _Stagecoach_ will be disappointed.

_Lost Highway_ is almost two movies.

It opens as a horror film, with Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette playing a couple on edge after receiving mysterious video tapes of their home. Director David Lynch shines here; bringing a palatable sense of dread to every scene that grows and grows, peaking with Robert Blake’s character’s first appearance, which stands out as the film’s highlight.

Then, abruptly, the film shifts into noir, bringing in a somewhat new cast. Lynch handles the new genre well, crafting a solid thriller somewhat reminiscent of his earlier film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0090756">_Blue Velvet_</span>.

What makes Lost Highway so special though, is what happens next. Lynch _blends_ the two genres right before our eyes, as the mystery becomes a horror and the horror becomes a mystery.

Lynch has a tendency, from time to time, to force too much of the storytelling on the audience. His breakthrough film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0074486">_Eraserhead_</span> is a prime example. Here though, the inclusion of co-writer Barry Gifford seems to temper Lynch enough to allow him to make a picture that’s more abstract than _Blue Velvet_ or <span data-imdb-id="tt0100935">_Wild at Heart_</span>, but yet more accessible than _Eraserhead_. While some will no doubt be put off by the film’s lack of direct explanation, Lynch and Gifford do give viewers enough to construct an explanation for themselves that is both rewarding and challenging. Indeed, _Lost Highway_ has almost limitless replay value, as new details emerge with every journey along the Möbius strip plot.

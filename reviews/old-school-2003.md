Grown men Wilson, Ferrell and Vaughn, start a college fraternity only to find themselves forced to prove their legitimacy to prevent their student members from being expelled.

Terrific performances from the three leads (including a breakout performance from Ferrell) keep the laughs coming, and the contrast between their macho rhetoric and their actions adds surprising depth.

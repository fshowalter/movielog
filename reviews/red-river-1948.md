A massive and desperate cattle drive up the Chisholm Trail creates a rift between a rancher (John Wayne) and his adopted son (Montgomery Clift).

The character of Thomas Dunson in director Howard Hawks’s + is widely regarded as one of John Wayne’s finest roles, and for good reason. As Dunson, a driven, but flawed man, we see Wayne cover a wide range of emotions, but never once go over the top.

Complimenting Wayne’s turn is a fine supporting cast including then-newcomer Montgomery Clift, Hawks-mainstay Walter Brennan, and frequent Wayne alumnus Paul Fix, Harry Carey, and Harry Carey Jr.

The script is solid, with believable characterization, and plenty of thrills. It's only flaws come in the form of some strained dialog from its two female characters, particularly Coleen Gray, and a somewhat watered-down ending.

Hawks’ direction is top-notch. Under his eye, Wayne gradually morphs from the cowboy he’d been playing for years into a larger than life tyrannical monster. Along the way, there’s a spectacular stampede sequence, and a well-paced Indian raid.

While the cinematography is excellent, _Red River_ should have been shot in color. Hell, the film’s title is _**Red** River_, and the lush green fields and blue skies giving way to the barren, rainy plains would have only served to reinforce Dunson’s transformation.

Still, it's a solid, near classic, western, and a fine beginning for Howard Hawks and John Wayne.

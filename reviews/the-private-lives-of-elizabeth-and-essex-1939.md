Queen Elizabeth I (Bette Davis) loves the dashing, yet ambitious Earl of Essex (Errol Flynn).

Despite its awful title, _The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex_ isn’t half bad. Originally called Elizabeth the Queen, the producers changed the title in acquiescence to Errol Flynn’s demands that his character be acknowledged in the title.

Flynn’s demands notwithstanding, this is Bette Davis’ picture. She gives a tour de force performance in the titular role that overshadows everyone else, including Flynn. She _feels_ like a queen, exuding a commanding presence, yet visibly exhausted by it.

Opposite her, Errol Flynn is very entertaining, but his performance is not on the same level as Davis’. Davis disappears into her character, while Flynn simply plays Errol Flynn.

Despite their lack of chemistry off-screen (Davis didn’t want Flynn for the role), it’s a testament to both performers talent that they’re so convincing on-screen.

Complementing, Davis and Flynn is a nice supporting cast including Olivia de Havilland and Vincent Price in his second film role.

Aside from the terrible title, _The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex_’s big flaw comes at its conclusion, when it opts for historical fact over fiction. The whole sequence is awkward, especially for Flynn’s character.

Awkward ending and title aside, however, _The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex_ is worth watching for Bette Davis’ performance alone.

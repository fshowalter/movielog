A psychiatrist’s secretary (Carol Burnett) concocts a scheme involving a fake wedding to help her friend (Elizabeth Montgomery) marry a TV star (Dean Martin) who’s lost faith in marriage.

_Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed_ is probably most notable as the screen debut for comedienne Carol Burnett, who later achieved fame with her wildly successful variety show. Unfortunately, despite the combined comedic talents of Burnett, Elizabeth Montgomery, and Dean Martin, this film just isn’t funny. At all.

The first half of the film deals with the wives of Dean’s poker buddies, who feel neglected by their husbands and turn to Dean for attention, confusing him with the perfect man he plays on television. This is where the trouble starts. See, none of these women are remotely likable. They all come off as shrill, nagging and clingy, and you can't help but sympathize with their husbands' desire to escape to a poker game. That said, the husbands are no catch either, which makes you wonder why the women married them in the first place.

Dealing with all these women soon drives Dean to a mini breakdown, just as it will drive you to turn off the film. If you stick around, you’ll see a strip tease number by Carol Burnett, and a pat, predictable ending. The husbands and their wives are forgotten.

_Who’s Been Sleeping in My Bed_ might have been funny, were it written and directed by Billy Wilder, who always loved this sort of material, but in the hands of director Daniel Mann, working from Jack Rose’s script, it’s a dud. Proof that a solid cast can’t overcome weak direction and a bad script. Unless you’re a big Carol Burnett fan, this is one to avoid.

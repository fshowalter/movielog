The true story of a man (Al Pacino) whose botched bank robbery turned into a media circus on a hot summer day in New York City circa 1972.

_Dog Day Afternoon_ is somewhat of a kindred spirit of <span data-imdb-id="tt0070666">_Serpico_</span>. Both were based on true stories, both were directed by Syndey Lumet, both share a gritty realism that permeates every scene, both tell the story of man pushed to extremes by his environment, and both feature knockout performances by Al Pacino.

_Dog Day Afternoon_’s only weak spot is the story, which, while interesting, doesn’t provide quite enough meat to sustain a two-hour movie. Still, what the story lacks, the script almost compensates for with some great dialog and colorful characters.

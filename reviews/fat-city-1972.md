An aging boxer (Stacy Keach) meets a young boxer (Jeff Bridges) and a barfly (Susan Tyrrell).

_Fat City_ is a gritty, unglamorous look at the life of an amateur boxer past his prime with no future ahead of him. All the performances are amazing, so much so that _Fat City_ doesn’t even feel like a movie, but rather a window into the lives of these people.

Director John Huston was sixty-five years old when he made _Fat City_ and he’d been directing movies almost non-stop for thirty years. Like Stacy Keach’s character in the film, you can feel Huston reaching for one last shot at something special but, like Keach, he falls short.

While _Fat City_ has realism and characterization in spades, it doesn’t really have any story. This movie could have worked as the pilot episode for a series, or the second act of a three-and-a-half-hour epic, but on its own, it’s just not enough. It's a slice of life movie that’s just not filling.

Fulci dips a toe in the avante garde with an amalgam of the stylisitic panaache he showed in <span data-imdb-id="">One on top of the Other</span> and the Gridhouse exploitation of <span data-imdb-id="">Consipiracy of Torture</span>. Flashier than either of those films, but marred by a cheat ending and a failure to exploit the London locales.

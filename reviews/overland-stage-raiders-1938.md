The Three Mesquiteers (John Wayne, Ray Corrigan, and Max Terhune) thwart bus, train and airplane hijackers.

_The Three Mesquiteers_ were supposed to be like a cowboy version of the Three Musketeers, set only in the old west. Except they’re not in the old west. There’s a bus and a couple of airplanes, one of which looks very modern, so maybe it’s the not-so-old west.

Either way, the film is weak. The addition of costars Ray Corrigan and Max Terhune only serves to detract from Wayne who had, by this time, proven himself capable of carrying a picture of this type, and the great fights and stunts, so prevalent in many of Wayne’s early westerns, just don’t shine through here. Even at only 55 minutes, _Overland Stage Raiders_ drags.

The only high note is the casting of Louise Brooks as Wayne’s romantic lead. This would be the iconic actress’s final film, and the first time Wayne’s female costar could hold the screen with him.

Thus, as a curiosity, it’s worth a look for Wayne and Brooks fans, but others should look elsewhere.

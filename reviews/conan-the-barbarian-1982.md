_Conan the Barbarian_ is a violent adult fantasy that positively drips testosterone.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as the titular character. He delivers a believable mix of savagery mixed with naivety that perfectly suits the role. Additionally, his muscular physique and innate charisma help him command a huge screen presence.

The supporting cast is equally well chosen. Sandahl Bergman’s toned build and tough exterior server her well as Conan’s love interest, a strong warrior molded in the image of his mother, while James Earl Jones’ deep voice lends an extra air of believability to his performance as a sinister cult leader.

As a character, Conan is pure testosterone. He steals, fights and carouses, taking whatever he wants, be it life or property, with no apologies or remorse. He’s the ultimate alpha-male. Yet the script by director John Milius and Oliver Stone is more than a glorified teenage fantasy. Through a hodgepodge of several of Robert E. Howard’s stories, it explores what makes a man what he is, as well as the emptiness inherit in revenge, all punctuated by Basil Poledouris’ thunderous, and oft-imitated, musical score.

Fresh out of prison, Caine, with the financial backing of gangster Coward, masterminds a daring armored car robbery on the streets of Turin.

Part light-hearted caper, part Mini Cooper commercial, the film coasts along on the strength of Caine's charm and the great location photography, but the non-ending makes this half a movie.

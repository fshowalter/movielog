A self-absorbed millionaire treats his attractive lawyer like a nanny, until she gets fed up and gives her notice.

_Two Weeks Notice_ is a nice comedy that relies on the star power of it's two leads. Hugh Grant is believable as smug, self-absorbed millionaire George Wade, although his boyish charm and disarming charisma allow the audience to like him in spite of his character flaws. Matching him perfectly is Bullock, who plays the self-assured yet vulnerable woman she's been charming audiences with since <span data-imdb-id="tt0111257">_Speed_</span>.

The script keeps the narrative going at a reasonable pace, and includes the requisite side plots involving greedy corporations and other romantic interests for Grant. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but the stars shine bright enough to make you overlook it.

A professor (Christopher Lee) investigates a woman (Barbara Shelley) and a doctor (Peter Cushing) who may be linked to the Medusa-like creature terrorizing a small village.

_The Gorgon_ is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it has nice production with good atmosphere, confident direction, and excellent pacing, but on the other hand, it has some of the worst makeup effects of any Hammer film, and a script that leaves a lot to be desired in the characterization department.

Despite receiving top billing, Christopher Lee is really only a supporting character and doesn't make his appearance until the film is almost half over. Sporting one of the worst costumes ever (love that moustache!), he plays an over-the-top cross between Sherlock Holmes and Van Helsing which, while entertaining, would have been better served by the more restrained Peter Cushing.

As for Cushing, he fares much better. Playing flawed doctor blinded by love, he's the highlight of the film. An additional bright spot is Michael Goodliffe, who commands a strong presence in a limited role.

In the end though, it's the awful special effects that undermine _The Gorgon_. The monster lacks any thrill, be it fearful or sexual in nature, and as a result fails to capture the audience's imagination. It's a nearly fatal blow that, were it not for the strong presences of both Lee and Cushing, would have crippled the film. As is, it just leaves it a shade disappointing.

A masked torturer and a scarred servant (Christopher Lee) terrify a woman recently arrived at her husband's ancestral castle in Germany.

_The Virgin of Nuremberg_ (_Horror Castle_ in the USA) is a well-photographed Italian horror film that shows glimpses of inspiration, but ultimately disappoints.

The art direction is top-notch, with beautiful castle interiors and suitable ominous, dark underground passages, all photographed exquisitely in crisp, vibrant color. Granted, the costumes could use a little work, as Rossana Podestà goes through much of the movie wearing pajamas and the chief baddie's hooded costume looks like a bad wrestling get-up, but still, despite it's low budget, the film doesn't feel cheap.

The problem lies with the script, which is all promise but no pay-off. Podestà's character alternates between headstrong heroine and weak-willed damsel-in-distress at the drop of a hat. And what's with the scene where, after successfully fighting off an intruder and barricading herself in her bedroom, she suddenly gets the urge to leave and run laps around the castle? Like so much in the film, it's purely plot-driven and makes no sense whatsoever.

That said, the film does show some potential. It's decidedly offbeat bee-bop score, while heavy on the orchestra hits, is certainly original (it also may have inspired part of Brad Fiedel's score of <span data-imdb-id="tt0089175">_Fright Night_</span>) though it would feel more at home in a James Bond film. The performers are all fine, though Christopher Lee is wasted in a too small part.

In the end though, fellow Italian Mario Bava directed a similar, albeit superior film nine years later in <span data-imdb-id="tt0069048">_Baron Blood_</span> which, if you haven't seen it, is worth seeking out over this one.

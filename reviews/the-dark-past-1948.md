_The Dark Past_ is a familiar story.

An escaped killer takes a hostage who ends up probing the killer's psyche. Think <span data-imdb-id="tt0028096">_The Petrified Forest_</span> or <span data-imdb-id="tt0047985">_The Desperate Hours_</span>.

Here, the killer is played by William Holden and the hostage by Lee J. Cobb. The twist that Cobb is a psychologist that works through Holden's "dark past." This means we get a lot of out-dated psycho-babble that drags down the film's third act.

Cobb and Holden are watchable, but that's about it. Watch _The Petriefied Forest_ or _The Desperate Hours_ instead.

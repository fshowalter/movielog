An aging actress (Bette Davis) grows increasingly wary of the young woman (Anne Baxter) who seems to adore her.

_All About Eve_ is a near-perfect story of fame, and the ambition it takes to achieve it. It’s also the most nominated film in Academy Awards history, with 14 nominations, including writer-director Joseph Mankiewicz and most of the cast.

Bette Davis gives a fearless performance as an aging actress refusing to acknowledge the bitter truth that her best days are behind her. Though it mirrored Davis’ career at the time, the role isn’t a flattering one, but Davis gives it her all, fleshing out Margo Channing into a talented, but nonetheless flawed, human being that you come to care about despite her rants and tantrums. No small feat.

Second only to Davis though, is George Sanders, whose Oscar winning performance as an insidious theater critic almost steals the film. His charming façade disguises a cold, ruthless man who sees himself as a step above everyone around him. While the role is perhaps a manifestation of Mankiewicz’s disdain for critics, in Sanders' hands it comes through as an altogether believable and three-dimensional character.

Anne Baxter is also impressive in the titular role of Eve Harrington. It’s essentially a dual role, either of which could be overplayed, but Baxter pulls it off well.

Finally, there’s the always-underrated Celeste Holm, whose considerable natural charm is a perfect fit for the role that anchors the film in a recognizable humanity.

With such a stellar cast, and a sharp, witty script, it's hard to find fault with All About Eve, though the length, almost two and a half hours, does cause the film to drag a bit here and there, though this will likely be less noticeable on repeat viewings, when the plot becomes secondary to the performances and dialog.

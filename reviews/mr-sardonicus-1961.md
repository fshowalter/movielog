A prominent surgeon (Ronald Lewis) receives word from an old flame that her husband (Guy Rolfe) is in need of his aid.

_Mr. Sardonicus_ is producer/director William Castle's version of a Hammer film. It's got all the trappings, an English cast headed by Ronald Lewis and Guy Rolfe (both recent Hammer alums), a gloomy gothic castle, and above-average B-movie production. Unfortunately, it's also shackled with a script that's fatally flawed.

The film works best during the first half, as Ronald Lewis' character arrives at the creepy castle and attempts to decipher the mystery behind his masked host, the Baron Sardonicus. It's good, creepy stuff, helped along by top-billed Oskar Homolka as Sardonicus' twisted servant. But then, at the halfway point, we get the whole story and all the mystery is gone. From there out the film becomes a predictable exercise in patience.

This is a shame, because the cast is good and the concept of Sardonicus is solid and resonant. Just the execution is lacking. All the ingredients are here for a great monster movie, only the script fails to structure them properly. By putting its cards on the table so early, the film robs us of the greatest horror, the fear of the unknown. By attempting to humanize Sardonicus' character, the film robs us of a truly monstrous villain.

Thus, _Mr. Sardonicus_ is really for Castle fans, who will appreciate his introduction and trademark gimmick ending, and horror movie buffs, who will recognize and appreciate the Sardonicus character's influence over the years.

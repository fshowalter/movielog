_Blood on the Moon_ is a solid western buoyed some great dialog, a strong supporting cast, and a smooth performance by Robert Mitchum.

Mitchum plays a stranger caught in a feud between a rancher and group of homesteaders. His cool, rugged demeanor and considerable physical presence naturally suit the part. Mitchum looks like a weary cowboy without evening trying.

Surrounding Mitchum is a solid supporting cast including Walter Brennan and Barbara Bel Geddes. While Bel Geddes comes off as quite annoying in her early scenes (a fault I attribute more to director Robert Wise than the script or Bel Geddes herself), she’s a different character entirely in the second and third acts.

The script by Lillie Hayward and Luke Short is very lean, and the dialog is certainly above average for the genre. Granted, a few of the homesteader’s get lost in the shuffle, and the ending is a little too pat, but these are minor quibbles.

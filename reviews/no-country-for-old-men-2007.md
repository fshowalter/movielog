After stumbling upon a drug deal gone bad in the desert, a man (Josh Brolin) takes a satchel full of money, unaware that a hit man (Javier Bardem) is on its trail.

_No Country for Old Men_ may be the Coen brothers’ best movie so far.

I say “so far” because I think _No Country for Old Men_ represents a kind of milestone for the Coens. They seem to have reached a point in their filmmaking where they’re confident enough in their style that they no longer need to emphasize it. Nor do they downplay it either. _No Country for Old Men_ has the usual quirks you’d expect in a Coen brothers film; they’re just not front and center, instead they’re more matter-of-fact.

Much of the credit undoubtedly belongs to Cormac McCarthy, whose novel provided the basis for the script, though kudos must be given to the Coens for drafting such a faithful screenplay. Their willingness to diverge from the standard Hollywood formula is a large part of what makes the film so satisfying.

_No Country for Old Men_ is several films in one. On the surface it’s the story of an everyman trying to get away with a satchel full of money, but beneath that it’s the story of the passing of time and the changes it brings, and beneath _that_ it’s a story about causality and the nature of fate. That the film works so well on each of these levels is a testament to its greatness.

As for the cast, it’s flawless. Tommy Lee Jones seems natural as a haunted, aging Sherriff, Javier Bardem is terrifying as an enigmatic hit man, and Josh Brolin anchors the entire story as a believable everyman who can’t walk away. Surrounding them is an outstanding supporting cast including Woody Harrelson (in his best role in years), Kelly Macdonald, and Barry Corbin.

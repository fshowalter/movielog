M would warrant five stars if I graded on technical merit alone. Director Fritz Lang demonstrates a formal mastery that belies his experience. This was his first sound picture, yet he's already innovating, delivering possibly the first instance of cross-cutting dialog in cinema.

But I don't grade on technical merit. I grade on my relative enjoyment of a film. That's how I can give lesser accomplished films a higher grade. I find them more entertaining. But in addition to birthing innovations in sound, M also birthed the procedural film: one of my least favorite genres.

M's story of the hunt for a child-killer in Berlin bored me. It proffers no mystery, revealing Lorre's identity early on. Instead it focuses on the manhunt, with both the police and underground desparate to find the culprit. I derive no interest or pleasure in watching the intricacies of police work, so these sections proved tedious. The finale is riviting, but it takes a while to get there.

I don't regret watching it--Peter Lorre's performance held me rapt, and the I appreciated the allusions to (and condemnation of) Nazism, as well as the sheer craft on display--but the film left me cold, with no interest in revisiting it later.

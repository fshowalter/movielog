William Powell plays an American espionage agent operating in Paris. An exfiltration mission goes awry resulting in his apprehension and deportation. But just as his ship reaches New York harbor, the captain recieves word Powell's to be held and returned to France. Powell jumps ship and swims ashore. Disavowed by the government and unable to find work, he finagles his way into a job as a private investigator, only to fall for a gambler played by Maragaret Lindsay who's targetted for a frame up operation by a crooked casino operator.

The opening spy antics cram a lot of extraneous plot into a brisk X minutes, but they also explain Powell's mallable ethics and lend credibility to his hard boiled persona. Still, Powell doesn't quite convince in a scene where he's interogating a goon at gunpoint. Lines like X sound better coming from Bogart.

Still, Lindsay proves charming and it's refreshing to see her character portrayed as shrewd and capable for most of the film. The third act necessitates her behaving like a helpless damsel, but she powers through like a pro.

The boss (Orson Welles) of a small Mississippi town tries to pair his daughter (Joanne Woodward) with an enigmatic drifter (Paul Newman).

_The Long, Hot Summer_ is a very well acted movie that just feels… off.

Paul Newman is fantastic as the opportunistic Ben Quick, hardened by life into a cynical shell of a man holding tight to his pride. Orson Welles is just as good as the gregarious boss who sees more than a little of himself in Quick. Anthony Franciosa is just right as Welles’ character’s son who feels abandoned after his father takes a shine to Quick, and Joanne Woodward does a good job as Welles’ character’s timid daughter, especially toward the film’s end.

Despite the great performances, _The Long, Hot Summer_ has its faults. After a dynamite opening, the script stumbles as it introduces Joanne Woodward and Lee Remick’s characters, wallowing in stilted southern drawl that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Fortunately, Newman shows up soon after, and Welles after that, and then the film’s back on track.

Uneven beginning aside, _The Long, Hot Summer_ has a bigger problem: it doesn’t look right. The world doesn’t have a lived in feel, as the costumes and sets all feel like props. Looking at some of the production stills, its clear the film should have been shot in black in white, like director Martin Ritt’s excellent <span data-imdb-id="tt0057163">_Hud_</span>, or John Huston’s superior Tennessee Williams adaptation <span data-imdb-id="tt0058404">_The Night of the Iguana_</span>; a choice likely out of Ritt’s hands, however.

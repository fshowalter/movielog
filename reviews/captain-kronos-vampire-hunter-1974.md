Janson is Kronos, a former soldier who travels the countryside hunting vampires with his hunchback sidekick.

This amalgam of Hammer horror, swashbuckling adventure, and black comedy hits more often than it misses, but Janson can't quite pull off the Eastwood-like anti-hero, thus dooming Hammer's attempt to build a franchise around him.

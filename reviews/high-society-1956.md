A pair of tabloid reporters (Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm) covers the wedding of a stuffy socialite (Grace Kelly) whose ex-husband (Bing Crosby) still holds a torch.

High Society is a somewhat musical remake of <span data-imdb-id="tt0032904">_The Philadelphia Story_</span>, notable as star Grace Kelly’s final film before she retired from acting to marry the Prince of Monaco.

Kelly delivers a fine farewell performance, easily equaling Katherine Hepburn’s turn in the original. Opposite her, Bing Crosby shines, oozing an easy charm in Cary Grant’s role. Supporting them, Frank Sinatra is entertaining albeit miscast in the James Stewart role, and Celeste Holm, fresh off her scene-stealing performance opposite Frank in <span data-imdb-id="tt0048705">_The Tender Trap_</span>, is absolutely perfect in Ruth Hussey’s role.

While not as funny, nor as touching, as the original, _High Society_ is entertaining enough. The songs are all good, especially the duet between Crosby and Sinatra, and the film moves quickly through its 111-minute running time.

That said, while fans of the stars should find this an easy ride, others would do better to check out the original.

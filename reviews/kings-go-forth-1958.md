_Kings Go Forth_ is a solid war melodrama highlighted by a great cast and good production.

In World War II France, Frank Sinatra and Tony Curtis play American soldiers vying for the affections of a young woman, played by Natalie Wood, who harbors a secret.

Curtis and Sinatra are really good opposite each other, so much so, you'll wish they had made more films together. Then again, Curtis has a way of making all of his costars look great, but regardless, the Jersey-born Sinatra and Bronx-born Curtis look and feel like a couple of Joes from the neighborhood, and they work perfectly as American soldiers trying to make the best of the situation in war-torn southern France.

Natalie Wood isn't quite as solid. Her accent never feels right, nor does her demure demeanor. Audrey Hepburn might have been a better choice were it not for a crucial plot point that pretty much disqualifies her (though it really disqualifies Wood too).

The script by Merle Miller from Joe David Brown's novel is a dark soap opera, and though the ending is a bit much, it's still a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood fare.

But ultimately it's the chemistry between Sinatra and Curtis that make _Kings Go Forth_ worth a look, especially for fans of either performer, as both were on the cusp of some of their most iconic roles; Curtis would follow this with <span data-imdb-id="tt0051525">_The Defiant Ones_</span>, while Sinatra would go on to make <span data-imdb-id="tt0052218">_Some Came Running_</span>.

A man (John Simm) falls for a mysterious woman (Christina Ricci) involved in a real-estate scam.

_Miranda_ is good. I think. Though I fear I may have lost the ability to objectively review movies featuring Christina Ricci. You see, this movie has a lot of things I'm a sucker for in addition to the aforementioned actress. First, the protagonist's name is Frank (always a good sign), second it has Kyle MacLachlan (who's actually gone full circle and now wonderfully echoes Dennis Hopper), and third, it's a British movie. Given all this, how could I resist?

That said, I really do think _Miranda_ is an enjoyable movie. Granted, it's probably a 'C' for most, but I can't help but give it a 'B'.

A Union Station cop (William Holden) tracks kidnappers using his station for a ransom drop-off.

_Union Station_ is a solid, if unremarkable, thriller featuring a re-teaming of <span data-imdb-id="tt0043014">_Sunset Boulevard_</span> stars William Holden and Nancy Olson.

Holden is good, albeit a bit miscast in a role that would have been perfect for Robert Mitchum. While Holden handles the part well, he lacks Mitchum’s haunted eyes and rugged demeanor, traits that would fit the part of a 24/7 cop. Still, Holden works with what he has, and makes the best of it, and while he does feel a bit “off” initially, by the time the credits roll such minor quibbles are long forgotten.

The script packs some stale dialog and takes a while to get rolling, but clocks in at a brief 81 minutes and avoids the myriad of clichés available. Further, Lyle Bettger’s character is refreshingly ruthless.

Visually, cinematographer Daniel L. Fapp does a fantastic job shooting in the darkened tunnels, painting large swaths of shadows in deep black while still capturing all the action.

_Union Station_’s biggest liability comes in the form of Allene Roberts, whose character is a shrieking mess that quickly becomes annoying. Yes, we get it, she’s blind and scared, but by overacting the part, she loses any sympathy the audience might have otherwise afforded her.

Thus, while not spectacular, _Union Station_ is a solid little thriller that’s worth a look for fans of William Holden.

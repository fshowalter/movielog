A lawyer (William Powell) and a socialite (Ginger Rogers) solve the mystery of a dancer's disappearance.

_Star of Midnight_ is yet another attempt by a rival studio to duplicate the success of MGM's <span data-imdb-id="tt0025878">_The Thin Man_</span>. For this entry, RKO got the genuine article in William Powell for the lead, cast Ginger Rogers in Myrna Loy's spot, and found a script with a lot of twists and turns. Unfortunately, the result isn't equal to the sum of its parts.

For starters, they've only got, at best, two-thirds of the formula. While Ginger Rogers is passable (and certainly much better than Jean Arthur in RKO's later _Thin Man_ clone, <span data-imdb-id="tt0027593">_The Ex-Mrs. Bradford_</span>) director Stephen Roberts is no substitute for W.S. Van Dyke.

_Star of Midnight_ lacks _The Thin Man_'s kinetic tension. Sure, this story has a lot of twists and turns, but Roberts fails to make us _care_. We're not so much watching to find out the mystery's solution, as much as we're just waiting to see it end. It's a fatal flaw that kills the film, turning what should be an involving mystery into a dull, talky affair.

That said, this one's reserved for Powell and Rogers fans only, as their performances are about the only things worth remembering in this boring mess.

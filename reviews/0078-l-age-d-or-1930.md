How does one review this movie? It opens as a nature documentary about scorpions, changes to (maybe?) a revolutionary drama, then changes again to a modern... romance? The film offers no story. The lone through line concerns two lovers struggling to consumate thier relationship.

But the imagery, oh the imagery. A woman enters an ornate bedroom to find a large steer atop the bed. It stumbles down and tramps about the room, sewing chaos, but the woman is nonplussed. Later a gala party, full of upper-crust types. Inside a mansion, a giant horse-drawn cart pushes through the partying masses who appear oblivious to it's presence. The film abounds with such striking shots, and clocking in at just over an hour, doesn't overstay its welcome.

Director Luis Bu√±uel delivers a film I can't claim to understand, but I won't soon forget.

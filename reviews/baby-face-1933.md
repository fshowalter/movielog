A young woman (Barbara Stanwyck) seduces a slew of men in her rise to the top of a New York bank.

_Baby Face_ is a rarity. Though made in 1933, it could be remade today without changing much of anything, and it would probably be a sizable hit.

Heavily cut upon its release to appease the censors, _Baby Face_ was one of the films that forced Hollywood to begin enforcing the motion picture code, and thus, _Baby Face_ was the last of its kind for quite some time.

And it’s a shame, because the film is actually pretty solid. Stanwyck is great in the lead, able to play coy and manipulative without losing the audience’s sympathy. Further, she's _believable_, that is, attractive enough to seduce the men around her, but also tough enough to throw them away once they’ve outlived their usefulness.

Supporting Stanwyck is a decent, if unspectacular, supporting cast. Look fast for a very young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck’s early conquests.

The script’s brief 76-minute running time keeps the plot cruising right along, and gives Stanwyck a lot of great lines flush with innuendo.

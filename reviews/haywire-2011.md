Carano plays a black ops contractor fighting to uncover the secrets behind a double-cross that's made her the target of an international manhunt.

Soderbergh's refreshing take on the action genre manages to be stylish and energetic without resorting to hyper-cut editing or bombastic explosions. For her part, Carano proves to be a capable lead, though it doesn't hurt that she's surrounded by a spectacular supporting cast.

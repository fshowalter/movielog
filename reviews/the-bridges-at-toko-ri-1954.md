_The Bridges at Toko-Ri_ is a decent war melodrama buoyed by a strong cast, good special effects, and an excellent ending.

Set during the Korean War, William Holden plays a Navy pilot who undertakes a dangerous mission to bomb key bridges in North Korea.

Stars Holden and Grace Kelly have charisma to spare, with Holden giving a nice preview of the cynical soldier persona he would perfect a few years later in <span data-imdb-id="tt0050212">_The Bridge on the River Kwai_</span>, and Kelly radiating her usual charm despite her thin role.

Supporting them, Fredric March is good as Holden's superior officer, and Mickey Rooney almost steals the film as a fiery tempered helicopter rescue pilot.

The film is uneven for most of its running time. Some scenes, especially the military action, work well thanks to the good production and excellent special effects, while others, such as the bath scene with Holden and his family, feel forced and artificial. This imbalance would really hurt the film if it weren't for the unexpected, yet utterly believable ending that saves the film.

Ultimately though, _The Bridges at Toko-Ri_ can't stand up to the aforementioned _Bridge on the River Kwai_ which trumps it in every aspect, be it performances, special effects, or even the ending. While fans of David Lean's film may want to give _The Bridges at Toko-Ri_ a look, don't hold it to the same standards.

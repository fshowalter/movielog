_The Spoilers_ is an entertaining John Wayne entry, notable chiefly for its strong cast.

The story, set in gold rush Alaska, sees cocky young miner Wayne rivaling a crooked official Randolph Scott for saloon owner Marlene Dietrich's affections.

Harry Carey proves affable as Waynes's partner, while Dietrich provides a leading lady capable of holding her own despite Wayne’s considerable screen presence. Opposite them, Scott plays a great villain and manages to make an impression despite having relatively little screen time.

The film’s highlight is a well-choreographed saloon brawl with Wayne and Scott trashing as much of the saloon as they do each other. Director Ray Enright’s decision to overcrank parts of this sequence is a questionable one, as the obvious effect detracts from the great stunt work.

The biggest problem with _The Spoilers_ though, is that it’s Marlene Dietrich’s picture. She gets top billing most of the screen time, despite the fact that Wayne is clearly the film’s biggest asset. Still, good production and a lean 87-minute script round help keep this one entertaining.

A young Quaker (Gail Russell) nurses a wounded gunman (John Wayne) back to health only to fall in love with him.

_Angel and the Badman_ is a solid John Wayne western notable as both the first film produced by Wayne, and as one of only two directorial efforts by Wayne’s longtime screenwriter James Edward Grant.

The film itself is solid. Wayne carries it well, and Gail Russell makes a good co-star with believable chemistry. Granted, the “thees” and “thous” in her dialog get a little grating after a while, but not enough to put you off the picture. Also, Harry Carey does a great job providing atmosphere with his role as a Marshal just itching to get Wayne’s character’s neck in a noose. This isn’t an epic story, or even a terribly original one, but it is well told.

As a director, Grant acquits himself well. While there’s nothing visually spectacular about _Angel and the Badman_, there’s nothing glaringly wrong either. It’s a nice, conservative effort that serves the story well, though judging by the fact that Grant directed only one other picture, and seven years later at that, it’s clear he felt his talents were better used as a writer.

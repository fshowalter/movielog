A witch (Kim Novak) casts a love spell on her publisher neighbor (James Stewart).

_Bell Book and Candle_ has all the ingredients to make a great movie. There’s star power (James Stewart, Jack Lemon, and Kim Novak), a great premise, and good production, but unfortunately the result isn’t as good as the sum of the parts.

The script, based on a play, simply isn’t very funny. Another director may have gotten more out of it (Billy Wilder would have been perfect), but we’ll never know. Director Richard Quine does a competent, but unremarkable job.

If not for the sheer charisma of principal cast, _Bell Book and Candle_ would be a chore to sit through but, like true stars, Stewart, Novak, and Lemon carry the picture.

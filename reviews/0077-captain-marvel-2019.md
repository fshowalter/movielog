Brie Larson deserves better. She's a rare performer who's innate charisma can smooth over a film's rough edges. Capitan Marvel has many. Consider the film's first quarter. We meander through an exposition-laden opening that exists only to enable the film's forced arc of self-discovery. This leads to a surprisingly cheap-looking set piece on an alien world. More flimsy mystery to build up the self-discover arc.

Then finally, the film finds its feet. She crash lands in 1990's Los Angeles and teams up with Samuel L. Jackson who's reprising his long-running role as super-spy Nick Fury. The Larson-Jackson pairing proves inspired. Their scenes together provide the film's best moments.

But this film has too many rough spots. Like skips on a record, their incongruity pulls you out of the narrative. We have a scene where the great Annette Benning, blue blood running from her temples, struggles to pull a ray gun from her bomber jacket to "blast the core". Or Ben Mendolson in full alien makeup sitting at a dinner table in rural Louisiana explaining his people's plight. The Marvel movies usually nail this sort of thing, whether it be a talking racoon, or Norse god come to earth, by finding the right tone--wehter it's comedy, sci-fi adventure, or heroic epic. This film tries to be all of those, but it also wants to be an earnest parable of female empowerment and a condemnation of imperialism. Tonally, it's all over the place and the shifts are jarring.

Captain Mavel didn't disappoint like Dr. Strange or the Ant-Man films. There's a lot to like here and Larson delivers. Imagine what she could have done with a better script.

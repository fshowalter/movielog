A horror film based on a Clive Barker story, with Barker himself as a producer. A young director whose debut gangster-zombie mashup eight years prior had already achieved cult-status. A lead in Bradley Cooper, months away from his breakthrough role in The Hangover. And an antagonist in Vinnie Jones at the peak of his run playing heavies, criminals, and villains. Yet the film underwhelms. Why?

Let me begin by saying, I don’t think The Midnight Meat Train is a disaster. The studio dumping it into second run theaters (I caught it’s one-night-only theatrical run on Halloween night at Landmark E-Street Theatre) had more to do with studio politics than the film’s quality.

Indeed, there’s a lot to like. The story follows Cooper, a photographer obsessed with capturing the city’s underbelly. A late-night shoot puts him on the train of Jones, a serial killer preying on late night train riders. Cooper’s capable of carrying the film, bringing a star-level charisma that helps gloss over his underwritten part. As does Jones, whose near-silent performance as a quiet, suit-clad commuter exuding a coiled rage and menace shines as the film’s highlight. Director Ryuhei Kitamura tinges the train sequences with a fluorescent-blue hue that matches Jones’s icy demeanor.

Indeed, the principals could have delivered a terrific film. But they can’t overcome the script.

Despite Barker’s involvement, Jeff Buhler’s script makes the same mistake as other failed Barker adaptations, such as Rawhead Rex: it loses the subtext. In Barker’s story, the protagonist was a office worker who’d grown disillusioned with New York City. The narrative cut between this officer worker and the serial killer, comparing and contrasting both men as living their lives in menial service to the city itself.

Lacking this subtext, Buhler’s script plays like a contrived thriller. There’s no deeper resonance, and the film’s attempts to fill this gap prove laughable. When a lecherous gallery owner—played by Brooke Shields who shines in a throwaway role—asks what interests him, Cooper replies, “The city … Because no one’s ever captured it. Not the way it really is … the heart of it.” Credit to both performers that they delivered this dialog with straight faces.

Buhler also shoehorns in a lot of cruft. Cooper’s a vegetarian who has his local greasy-spoon make him vegan cheesesteaks with tofu he brings himself in little tupperware containers. He’s got a girlfriend who wants to marry him, and seems to exist only to raise the third-act narrative stakes, and an agent who exists to deliver exposition.

Such a script proves a large handicap, but Cooper and Jones could have salvaged something passable if the film featured some solid practical effects. Jones’ murders are brutal and over-the-top, as he leverages a slaughterhouse hammer to pulverize his victims, crunching bones and—in one scene that hints at a possible 3D intent—sending an eyeball popping out of a victim’s socket. But it’s all CGI. The blood and gore exist in the uncanny valley. They look real and animated at once, pulling you out of the scene, and robbing it of any visceral thrills.

And topping it off, the film even drops the New York City setting—a budget casualty. Setting it instead, in an unnamed city that looks a lot like Los Angeles. At least this would explain how Cooper’s girlfriend—played by Leslie Bibb—would be working in a diner.

Again, this film isn’t a disaster. The changes to the source material reek of studio notes and the CGI and transplanted setting, of budget restrictions. The principals should have pivoted to an original story. One that afforded the supporting cast better written parts. One with fewer sets to free up budget for practical effects. And one with an ending that felt earned instead of just shocking.

If you’ve read Barker’s short story, this adaptation will disappoint. If you haven’t, I encourage you to watch this first. You’ll enjoy it more that way. Then read Barker’s story and imagine what could have been.

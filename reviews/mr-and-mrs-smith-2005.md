After five (or six) years of marriage, a sedate couple (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) each discover the other is a rival assassin.

_Mr. & Mrs. Smith_ is, on the surface, a cartoonish action picture, and on this level the movie works fairly well. Just below the surface, however, is a really dark comedy about marriage. On this level, the movie _rocks_.

As usual, director Doug Liman turns in a beautifully photographed picture, and manages to coax great performances out of the entire cast (especially Vince Vaughn, who steals all his scenes).

The final over-the-top, knock down, drag out battle royale between stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, will leave you in stitches. And if the movie ended here it would have been 'A' material. Unfortunately it doesn't, but that shouldn't deter you.

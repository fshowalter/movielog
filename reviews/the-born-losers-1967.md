A part-Indian cowboy battles a ruthless gang of bikers in a small town.

Watching _The Born Losers_ you'd be hard pressed to believe its sequel, <span data-imdb-id="">_Billy Jack_</span>, would go on to gross millions of dollars. Aside from what was, at the time, pretty graphic violence, and lots of shots of girls in their underwear there isn't a lot to recommend.

The lead character, Billy Jack, played by writer director Tom Laughlin really doesn't have much screen presence, the script meanders, and the supporting case overacts.

Still, the movie does tap into the building frustration of the American psychosis that would later erupt in such superior films as <span data-imdb-id="tt0066999">_Dirty Harry_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0071402">_Death Wish_</span>, as in doing so, does leave you with something. Just not a whole lot.

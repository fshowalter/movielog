In a Japanese POW camp, a British Colonel (Alec Guinness) becomes obsessed with completing a bridge for the enemy, unaware that a commando (Jack Hawkins) and an escapee (William Holden) plan to blow it up.

_The Bridge on the River Kwai_ is a perfect mix of psychological drama and epic adventure that won seven Oscars including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Alec Guinness, Best Director for David Lean, and Best Picture of the Year.

It's difficult to overstate just how well crafted the film is, from Guinness' excellent portrayal of the complex Colonel Nicholson, to the breath taking photography and epic finale, _The Bridge on the River Kwai_ manages to be both incredibly nuanced and sweepingly epic.

Despite his top billing, this isn't William Holden's film. He's off-screen for large chunks of time, though his character serves the critical purpose of playing the improbable everyman, seemingly repulsed by the horror of war and the feigned nobility, only to rise to the occasion when the moment calls. While his arc isn't as powerful as Guinness' is, it nonetheless affords the audience a more relatable character.

Perhaps the best thing about the film though, is how well it holds up to repeat viewings, particularly the finale, which always plays just as tense as the first viewing. This timelessness, more than anything, is what makes _The Bridge on the River Kwai_ one of the greats. Highly Recommended.

A New York gang fights their way across the city in an attempt to reach their home turf of Coney Island after they realize they've been framed for the murder of a popular gang leader.

If _The Warriors_ were made today, you'd swear it was based on a video game. The plot and pacing are so similar it's uncanny. Indeed, the film has likely served as the inspiration for more than a few games since it's release thirty years ago, but at the time it's primary influence was probably comic books, a fact director Walter Hill amplifies in the new "Ultimate Director's Cut."

To that end, the film is an amazingly fluid piece of pulp, immersing the viewer in a lawless world where gangs run wild and the first priority is survival. Rather than paint the film as a horror, which would be very easy to do, Hill turns it into a vicarious thrill ride packed with action and adventure. Looking past the late 70s fashions, the film ages very well and boasts solid performances from its entire young cast, as well as some choice dialog.

Thus, _The Warriors_ will sorely disappoint those looking for a gritty, realistic urban drama, but those tuned into its pulp sensibilities will likely be pleasantly surprised.

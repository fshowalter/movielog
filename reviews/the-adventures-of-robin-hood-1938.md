Nobleman Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn) turns outlaw to save England and Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) from the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and Prince John (Claude Rains).

_The Adventures of Robin Hood_ is the definitive Robin Hood adaptation, made possible by a perfect cast, great script, and wonderful Technicolor photography.

Errol Flynn owns the film. That he’s a dashing and charming adventure hero is a given, but that he can pull it off in green tights is amazing. Flynn handles the dramatic scenes with equal prowess, romancing Olivia de Havilland and verbally sparring with Claude Rains with a cocky charm that’s irresistible.

The script by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller starts with a bang and never lets up, moving with the utmost efficiency, while still maintaining a genuine sense of drama. Though the underlying Saxon versus Norman political conflict seems a little extraneous, it never gets in the way of the story.

For his part, director Michael Curtiz delivers one timeless set pieces after another, including the oft-imitated fencing sequence between Flynn and Rathbone at the film’s finale, as well as the classic archery competition.

Finally, with the exception of a few day-for-night shots that don’t really work, the Technicolor photography is amazing. Colors seems so vivid, whether it be the green of Flynn’s costume or the blue of de Havilland's, that the film almost seems _painted_ onto the screen.

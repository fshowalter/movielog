A mutant killer snowman terrorizes people on a tropical resort.

_Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman_ is awful. It's not funny, it's not scary, it's not even creative. Shot on digital video, it's obvious the budget was next-to-nothing, and it shows. The acting is painful, with no comedic timing or charisma exhibited by any of the cast. The lack of effort in this film is painfully obvious, as if everyone involved is just going through the motions. Sure, it's fun to laugh at bad movies, but the reason <span data-imdb-id="tt0052077">_Plan 9 from Outer Space_</span> and others are so enjoyable is because you get the sense that the filmmakers are actually _trying_, which just isn't the case here.

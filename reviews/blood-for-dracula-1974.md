_Blood for Dracula_ (_Andy Warhol's Dracula_ in the US) is an aimless mess.

Despite the US title, Andy Warhol had nothing to do with the film, which is the brainchild of writer-director Paul Morrissey, who shot it immediately after the superior <data data-imdb-id="tt0071508">_Flesh for Frankenstein_</span> using the same cast and crew.

Working from a script with no ending, Morrissey forgoes any kind of real story or theme in favor of over-the-top sex and gore, allowing his cast to improvise along the way. While there are moments when this works, they're too few and far between.

The result is a film that's surprisingly boring. Udo Kier's Dracula is a sickly, whiney man-child who's anything but terrifying, and lead Joe Dallesandro's porn-quality performance as Italian servant named Mario replete with Brooklyn accent is laughably bad.

By the time the finale rolls around, Morrissey, in a weak attempt to give this 106-minute mess some meaning feeds Dallesandro's character some Marxist ramblings about class equality and revolution, but it's too little, too late to make _Blood for Dracula_ worthwhile. Watch _Flesh for Frankenstein_ instead.

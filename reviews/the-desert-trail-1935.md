A rodeo star (John Wayne) and his gambler buddy (Eddy Chandler) are mistaken for robbers.

_The Desert Trail_ is somewhat of a refreshing diversion from the usual Lone Star western formula. Sure, there’s still the classic case of mistaken identity that puts the Duke at odds with the law, but this is a different Duke then we’re used to seeing. Early on, he pulls a gun on a cashier to ensure he gets his promised share of the prize pool, even though it’ll likely bankrupt the rodeo, and later he’s shooting at the posse that’s come to arrest him, believing him guilty of armed robbery and murder. In between, he even beats up his buddy and blatantly ogles women.

Further differentiating _The Desert Trail_ is the superior cast. The young Paul Fix does a good job as head baddie Al Ferguson’s reluctant partner, and Mary Kornman is actually both charming and attractive as Wayne’s romantic lead. Rounding out the cast is Eddy Chandler who turns in an entertaining enough performance as Wayne’s character’s gambling buddy.

A darker Wayne and superior script don’t preclude director Lewis D. Collins from including some Lone Star staples, though. Seamlessly spliced in are some of Yakima Canutt’s classic stunts, including the famous horseback window dive, as well as a well-done stagecoach sequence, all in a brief 54-minute running time.

While it’s ultimately a B-movie, _The Desert Trail_ represents the best of Wayne’s Lone Star westerns and--taken in that context--should entertain both Wayne fans and fans of the genre.

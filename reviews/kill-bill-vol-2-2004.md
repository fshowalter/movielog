A female assassin (Uma Thurman), left for dead on her wedding day, continues her quest for revenge on those that wronged her.

While _Kill Bill: Vol. 2_, like its predecessor, does place style over substance; this time the style is darker and the substance is a little more substantial.

Originally one long movie, the split between _Volume 1_ and _Volume 2_ seems natural. While the first volume plays like an homage to Asian pop culture, the second is an homage to the revenge films of the 70s (a large <span data-imdb-id="tt0071866">_Mr. Majestyk_</span> poster is shown prominently on the wall of Michael Madsen's character's trailer) and, as such, works very well. Sure, the kung-fu is still here, but the over-the-top choreography of _Volume 1_ is replaced by more brutal, 1-on-1 encounters that seem much more violent than anything in the first movie.

Unfortunately, this shift in tone is _Kill Bill: Vol. 2_'s undoing. As the movie unwinds it hints at a greatness it never achieves, and by the time David Carradine delivers his dissertation on Superman, the viewer can't help but hope for a payoff that's more than this movie delivers.

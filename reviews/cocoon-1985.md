After swimming in a pool with mysterious cocoons, a group of Florida seniors finds they once again have the vitality and stamina of their youth.

_Cocoon_ is a classic sci-fi tale with a twist. Instead of teenagers--or even newlyweds--in the lead, you have a group of senior citizens. This simple twist however, reinvigorates what would otherwise be a fairly tired plot, and gives the film an extra gravitas as mediation on aging and society’s treatment of senior citizens.

The performers, both young and old, are excellent, with Hume Cronyn and Brian Dennehy particular standouts.

_Cocoon_ does have a few missteps though. The special effects don’t age very well at all, especially the now almost-laughable shriveled alien, and the big climax feels forced, as if the filmmakers didn’t believe the audience would accept a quieter, more meditative ending.

Still, it's descent little movie that will, I suspect, resonate more as my own years tick by.

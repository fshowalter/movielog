An army major trains 12 condemned soldiers for a suicide mission behind enemy lines during World War II.

_The Dirty Dozen_ is a guy's movie. More precisely, _The Dirty Dozen_ is _the_ guy's movie. It practically sweats testosterone. Don't look for romance, caring, or understanding. Those themes don't have any place in the uber-male world created here. This is a movie about guys, for guys, and it never pretends to be anything else.

This machismo extends to every aspect of the film, including its cast. Here _The Dirty Dozen_ lives up to its name. There are no pretty boys, and you won't find any of the stars on a teenage girl's wall. Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin aren't on screen to look good for the camera, they're there to look tough.

And tough they are. While the entire film is perfectly cast, Marvin and Bronson especially seem born to play their respective roles. Telly Savalas also delivers a truly frightening performance that will stay with you long after the film is over.

_The Dirty Dozen_ has its flaws. With 13 characters some are bound to be underdeveloped, and at times we lose track of where everyone is. Also at 145 minutes the movie does come in a little long. The finale will make you forget these minor quibbles though, as it's one of the best action sequences ever.

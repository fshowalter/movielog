Anna Farris plays an actress who unwittingly eats an entire plate of pot cupcakes, then finds herself at the center of several misadventures.

Director Gregg Araki’s film is refreshingly funny, and features an award worthy performance from Faris. While it may not have broken box office records, it deserved a theatrical run. A small run in college towns could have built a strong cult following.

Dylan Haggerty’s script is a mix of stoner humor, screwball comedy, and genuine inspiration; a tone he establishes perfectly in the film’s opening scene. Further, at only 88 minutes Smiley Face acknowledges it’s more or less a one-joke movie, and doesn’t wear out its welcome.

For her part, Faris carries the film with ease. It’s a tricky proposition, as her character could easily come across as self-absorbed and lose the audience’s sympathy, but Faris walks the line, winning you over from the very first scene.

That said, _Smiley Face_ isn’t a touching film, or one with a resounding message, it’s 88 minutes of inspired insanity that takes its rightful place alongside <span data-imdb-id="tt0366551">_Harold and Kumar_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0486551">_Beerfest_</span>, and other great “party” movies.

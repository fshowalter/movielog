Bale plays a young, rich investment banker struggling to contain his homicidal impulses and maintain his facade of normalcy in 1980's New York. Bale straddles the line of charm and menace with ease and Harron's decision to omit the source material's more graphic elements and play up the black comedy works well. Some of the sets betray the film's low budget, but this is still an improbably good adaption of what seemed like an unfilmable book.

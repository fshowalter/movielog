_Reservoir Dogs_ is slick.

Writer-director Quentin Tarantino borrows and steals from every genre in the book to tell this story of group of thieves dissecting a botched robbery.

In so doing, Tarantino creates a style all his own that’s been aped countless times since. The script is crammed with great dialog and quotable lines.

The casting is perfect. From a seemingly resurrected Lawrence Tierney, to the eerily cool Michael Madsen, there isn’t a weak link in the chain.

The only weakness is in the story itself. Tarnatino tells it as well as can be done, but it’s inherently weaker than other heist films such as Heat. Still, while it’s not perfect, it’s damn close.

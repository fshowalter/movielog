A newspaper reporter (Lee Tracy) falls for the daughter (Fay Wray) of a suspicious scientist (Lionel Atwill) he's assigned to investigate.

_Doctor X_ has a couple of big problems: Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill are the only performers with any screen presence, and the script is laughably bad, with gaping plot holes and stilted dialog.

Though _Doctor X_ only runs 76 minutes, it feels almost half an hour longer.

Yet, despite of all these problems, _Doctor X_'s great sets, and excellent early use of 2-color Technicolor will make it attractive to some.
